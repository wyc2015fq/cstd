The **Web ARChive (WARC)** archive format specifies a
method for combining multiple digital resources into an aggregate
archive file together with related information. The WARC format is
a revision of the Internet Archive's ARC File Format[5] that has
traditionally been used to store "web crawls" as sequences of
content blocks harvested from the World Wide Web. The WARC format
generalizes the older format to better support the harvesting,
access, and exchange needs of archiving organizations. Besides the
primary content currently recorded, the revision accommodates
related secondary content, such as assigned metadata, abbreviated
duplicate detection events, and later-date
transformations.[6]
