欢迎大家今年4月6-8号来宾大参加2018年Geometry Festival。

**GEOMETRY****FESTIVAL****2018**

**University of Pennsylvania**

**Philadelphia, PA 19104**

**Friday April 6 - Sunday April 8, 2018**




The 33rd Annual Geometry Festival will be held at the

Department of Mathematics of the University of Pennsylvania,

from Friday afternoon April 6 to Sunday noon April 8, 2018.




***It will be in honor of Eugenio Calabi,***

***on the occasion of his 95th birthday.***




Everyone is invited to the Geometry Festival, and graduate students are especially encouraged to attend.  A continuing grant from the National Science Foundation makes it possible for us to partially reimburse the expenses of a large number of graduate students, post-docs and younger faculty who do not have access to travel funds from other sources.  A substantial portion of this funding can be committedin advance, and experience shows that additional funds for this purpose are usually available after conference expenses have been met.




**The speakers are:**




**Yasha Eliashberg**

**Benson Farb**

**Carolyn Gordon**

**Daniel Ketover**

**Yevgeny Liokumovich**

**Rick Schoen**

**Jenny Wilson**

不过根据我老板的说法，NSF好像还没批准经费申请。。所以不能保证报销的比例。这年头拿经费真是越来越难了。。
