# 经济学理论的三个层次 - 知乎

**这是本专栏的第 *27* 篇日记**

离上一篇专栏已经快一个月了……深表抱歉……

这次的专栏内容翻译自本学期高微II的Magill教授和Quinzii合著的《Theory of Incomplete Market》一书，原文附于文末。本书包含了大量技术细节，不建议非相关专业同学阅读，但是这一段内容很好地解答了经济学（以及其它学科）的理论研究的一个常见问题，即**“为什么许多（经济学）理论缺乏对现实中各种实际发生的事件和现象的解释能力？”**故特别译出。

以下为译文：

经济学的理论可以分成三个层次或者说类别（其它学科也是如此）。第一个层次的理论可以被称为*“直觉理论”*，这样的理论通常基于一些简单的概念，包含一些直接的、直觉的、定性的命题，通常可能拥有非常广泛的应用。大多数经济学理论一开始都处于这个层次，许多更加深入的对经济学概念的理解也植根于此。“直觉理论”最主要的弱点在于，其所涉及的概念都是不甚明确的，相应的也就难以不受质疑地给出定性结果成立所需要的准确条件。这样一来，建立一个自洽而成熟的理论，其中的概念和结果都严丝合缝，就变得非常困难甚至是不可能完成的。

第二个层次的理论是*“规范理论”*，在这一阶段分析会更加精确，理论中的概念都用满足一定关系的变量加以明确定义。通过数学手段，我们可以从这些关系中进一步地推导出其它性质。“规范理论”是理论发展中一个重要的中间阶段：更加精确的数学推导不仅能够让我们得到更加准确的预测，而且也能够得到更加简明的命题。

第三个层次的理论是*“抽象（数学）理论”*：在这种最高层次的抽象下，一些最基础的概念被表达为*公理*（或者*假设*），由此衍生的概念通过*定义*获得了明确的含义，而理论的定性结果被表达为明确的*定理*，并由严格的数学*证明*保证其正确性。“抽象理论”的优势在于，在论证的每一步中都坚持做到完全明确：无论是公理、定义、定理还是证明。因此，从原则上说，论证的每一步都不会有任何模棱两可的地方。这样的理论建立在坚实的地基之上，所有得到的结果都可以被进一步用来作为理论后续拓展的砖石。

一般而言，一个学科的概念发展得越简明，它就越能够用精确的数学手段所描述。一项理论发展到第三个层次后，最重要的一点就是我们将更加明确地了解这个理论能够或者不能够解释什么。这种明确也必然有其代价：在“抽象数学理论”中所得出的定理尽管更加准确，但往往依赖于比“直觉理论”中不那么明确的定性结果更加有限制性的假设。正因为其不明确，我们才能够将“直觉理论”中的定性结果与更加广泛的领域相联系，以此为如何发展“规范理论”和“抽象理论”提供重要的指引。因此，这三个层次在经济学理论的发展中是互补地进行的。

以下为原文：

In economics, as in every branch of science, three levels or types of theory can be distinguished. The first level, which may be called* intuitive theory*, is based on a few simple concepts which lead by direct and intuitive arguments to qualitative propositions which may have considerable breadth of application. Most economic theory begins at this level and most of our broader conceptual understanding of economics has its roots in this category. The chief weakness of intuitive theory arises from the element of vagueness in the underlying concepts, with the result that precise conditions under which qualitative results hold can often not be established beyond question. This makes it difficult (and perhaps impossible) to develop a coherent and sophisticated theory in which the concepts and results fit together in a watertight manner.  

The second level is *formal theory*: at this stage a new level of precision enters the analysis since concepts are defined precisely by means of variables which satisfy certain relations. These relations are used to establish further properties using intuitive mathematical arguments. Formal theory is an important intermediate stage in the development of a theory: the new level of mathematical precision leads not only to more precise predictions but also to clearer propositions.  

The third level is *abstract (mathematical) theory*: this is the final level of abstraction where primitive concepts are expressed as *axioms* (or* assumptions*), derived concepts are given a precise meaning through *definitions* and the qualitative results of the theory are stated in precise *theorems* whose validity is established by rigorous mathematical *proofs*. The advantage of abstract theory is that it insists on complete clarity at each stage of the argument: in axioms, in definitions, in theorems and in proofs. Thus, in principle, there is no ambiguity in any part of the argument. Theory is placed on firm foundations and results once established can be used as building blocks for subsequent extensions of the theory.

In general, as a science advances in the clarity and simplicity of its concepts, the more it is amenable to precise mathematical formulation. The principal advantage of reaching the third level is that it becomes much clearer exactly what the theory is or is not capable of explaining. There is however a cost to this precision: while the theorems which are obtained in an abstract mathematical theory are more precise, they are also typically based on more restrictive assumptions than the less precise qualitative results that are established using intuitive theory. Exactly because it is less precise, intuitive theory often enables us to link broader areas of the subject with qualitative results that can provide an important guide to the appropriate way to develop formal and abstract theory. The three levels are thus complementary ways of developing economic theory.
