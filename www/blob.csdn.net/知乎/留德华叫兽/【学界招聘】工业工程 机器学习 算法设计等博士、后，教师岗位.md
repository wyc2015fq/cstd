## **1、PhD position in Predictive Analytics for Early Warning of Influenza like Illness at University of Auckland, New Zealand(Mehnaz Adnan)**
![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-0789d602e28f2add9661b192cd5d60b8_b.jpg)
**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

The usefulness of internet-derived data in decision support has been recognized internationally in many domains including the investigation of epidemiological trends of specific diseases. Within Institute for Environmental Science and Research (ESR), there are many potential use cases for such a system – in our communicable disease surveillance work on behalf of the Ministry of Health, in our drinking water monitoring work or in our work alongside NZ police and customs officials to track dangerous new

synthetic drugs that are damaging communities across New Zealand. In our ongoing work, ESR found that weekly google trends data shows a strong correlation with reported cases of influenza like illness reported via the traditional surveillance system. The overall objective of this research is to implement a data intelligence platform which targets the early prediction of influenza like illness via real time monitoring of internet and social media data.

The successful candidate will work with ESR epidemiologists, health Informaticians and data scientists to develop a real time data processing pipeline that monitors internet media posts and makes predictions on how the emerging intelligence will change the number of influenza like illness cases seen by New Zealand’s health system.

The project will take an iterative and agile approach covering three main deliverables which will form the early warning system for Influenza like Illness:

1.Near real-time data acquisition from internet sources, including data cleaning and natural language processing.

2.Developing predictive machine learning models to forecast short term influenza trends and identify potential new outbreaks.

3.Producing ways to visualize the latest emerging trends and report on future predictions via tools such as an interactive dashboard and an email alert system.

While this project focusses specifically on influenza like illnesses, we anticipate that the solution developed should be applicable to a broad range of threats to communities in ESR research areas such as health, drugs and the environment. Finally, while the initial focus will be on mining data from existing internet sources such as social media feeds, the scope of the project leaves open the possibility to investigate and develop new ways to leverage internet connected technologies to create new ways to collect new sources of data such as via apps or chatbots.

**QUALIFICATION:**

The student should have strong programming skills (R or Python) with interest in natural language processing, machine learning and predictive modelling. It would be ideal if the student has some exposure to health data and have done Machine Learning at the undergraduate/postgraduate level.

The scholarship will cover PhD tuition fee and a stipend of**$27,600** (as per University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarships) for the first year and will continue for the following two years’ subject to the availability of funding. The student can work either from ESR’s Mount Albert Science Centre in Auckland or Kenepuru Science Centre in Wellington.

## **2、Postdoc positions on Algorithmic and Mechanism Design Research in Online Markets at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy(Stefano Leonardi)**
![](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-1ce5700e211aaae410d877c47dc1da13_b.jpg)
**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Two postdoc positions within the ERC Advanced Grant project "Algorithmic and Mechanism Design Research in Online Markets" (AMDROMA) led by Stefano Leonardi are available at Sapienza University of Rome. 

The project AMDROMA considers research questions in algorithms and mechanism design that are central for today's Internet economy. The focus of the work will be on the development of new methods in research areas such as algorithmic mechanism design, online and approximation algorithms, modelling uncertainty in algorithms and mechanisms, and large-scale algorithmic data analysis. 

The project also intends to apply the new methods to solve specific problems in Internet advertisement, sharing economy, and online labor market places. 

Each postdoctoral researchers will be associated to one or more of the three areas of investigation of AMDROMA: 

1.market and auction design,

2.models of uncertainty and algorithmic learning，

3.large-scale matching and clustering methods. 

The research will primarily focus on theoretical investigation, data driven modeling, and experimental validation. Postdocs of AMDROMA are expected to contribute in defining research problems of interest of the project, finding and analyzing novel solutions, writing research papers, and collaborating with PhD students and other postdoctoral researchers.  

**QUALIFICATION:**

Applicants should hold a PhD or be close to complete a PhD in computer science, computer engineering, or related fields. There are two levels for the position: Junior and Senior Postdoctoral Researcher. Fresh PhDs will be considered for the first level and everybody else for both levels. 

The position can start as soon as possible. The positions can be extended up to three years. Salary is competitive at the European level. 

**APPLICATION:**

Applications including a CV and a statement of research should be sent to Stefano Leonardileonardi@diag.uniroma1.it preferably before **September 30th, 2018**.


## **3、Postdoc position in distributed computing and its applications to distributed systems at Institute of Science and Technology Austria **
![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-abaca8a5de5f40960eafa26b4f0dc69c_b.jpg)
**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

The Distributed Algorithms and Systems Group at IST Austria has two open postdoctoral positions. We are broadly interested in distributed computing and its applications to distributed systems, with a focus on distributed optimization and machine learning.

The positions are part of the ScaleML ERC Starting Grant project, whose goal is to develop new theory, algorithms, and systems for scalable machine learning. The ideal candidate would have a strong background in CS, with a PhD in distributed computing or a related field. Applicants with experience in optimization theory or distributed systems implementation are particularly encouraged, although all strong applicants will be given proper consideration.

For questions about the positions and the application process, please contact dan.alistarh@ist.ac.at. The application should contain a CV, publication list, a 1-page statement describing motivation and research interests, and links to your top two or three publications.

The Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria) is a young international institute dedicated to basic research and graduate education in the natural and mathematical sciences, located on the outskirts of Vienna. IST Austria is committed to equality and diversity.
