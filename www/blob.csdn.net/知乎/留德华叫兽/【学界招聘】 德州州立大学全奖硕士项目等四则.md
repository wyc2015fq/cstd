## **1、德州州立大学工业工程全奖硕士项目                    **

**美国德州州立大学**(Texas State University)的工业工程硕士项目是一个two-year long并且需要完成论文的硕士项目。该项目比较年轻，今年第三年，但前景非常的好；欢迎大家积极申请。

★★★★★奖学金丰厚。今年工业工程方向录取的7名硕士学生，其中6名有奖学金资助。资助的形式分为Fellowship（免学费，并且每个月补助$1350左右）；或者Assistantship （州内学费，约$5000一学期，并且每个月补助$1350左右）。另外，在德州的收入不需要交state income tax。

★★★★★评优以及额外奖学金。美国的大学一般仅对本科生进行评优，比如常见的Dean’s List。德州州立大学对研究生也有评优，表现突出者可以获得额外的奖学金。

★★★★★师生比很低。目前工业工程方向一共五位老师，硕士的师生比在1:1-1:2左右，学生能得到老师充分的关注和培养。

★★★★★就业/升学前景好。德州经济发达，很多industry都需要招收工业工程相关的毕业生，比如航空、铁路、石油、半导体等行业。同时德州也有不少学校有很不错的相关博士项目，比如UT Austin和TAMU，适合有意继续深造的同学。

★★★★★适宜居住学习。德州州立大学位于德州San Macros市，离德州首府奥斯汀仅半小时车程，属于Greater Austin Area。奥斯汀连续几年被福布斯评选为美国最适宜居住的城市第一名，生活成本低，幸福指数高，是一个学习生活的好地方。

欢迎数学、编程基础好的同学进行申请！对该硕士项目感兴趣并且希望得到奖学金资助的同学，请在2019年2月1日之前完成网络申请：[http://us10.campaign-archive1.com/?e=&u=fc8cbe1355469fb7bb894bbc3&id=aa8a00719e](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//us10.campaign-archive1.com/%3Fe%3D%26u%3Dfc8cbe1355469fb7bb894bbc3%26id%3Daa8a00719e) 。需要有GRE和托福（或者雅思）成绩，GRE分数无硬性要求，托福要求78分以上，雅思要求6.5分以上。

## **2、PhD scholarship in Machine Learning and Operations Research (Technical University of Denmark)**

The **Machine Learning for Mobility group and the Operations Research group**of the **Technical University of Denmark **(DTU), Department of Management Engineering, are looking for excellent applicants to pursue **PhD studies, starting in October 2018**.

The focus of this research lies in the intersection between Machine Learning and Operations Research: we want to work on Predictive Optimization.

Traditionally, prediction and optimization have been seen as two separate processes to be executed one after the other, assuming no interdependency between the two. This assumption, however, does not always hold. Take for example the transport industry. Assume an autonomous bus deployed on a dynamic network that changes depending on the incoming online requests of passengers. Given the route that the bus will take, the number of requests might also change. A potential passenger that can see the bus is near, might decide to make a request while the opposite can be true if the bus is far away hence longer waiting time are expected. Using the traditional approach, one could forecast the travel requests and then use an optimization technique to find an optimal route. The identified route might, however, change the passenger forecast as now more information is available. It would then be reasonable to include the route information into the forecast and re-calculate it. This is an example, where the forecast and the optimization are inter-dependable. Methods that combine forecasting and optimization are what we call Predictive Optimization.

**In this project we aim at identifying one or more predictive optimization solution frameworks that can be applied to a range of problems**. The project will be rooted around a real-life application, where data from a car-sharing company (e.g. Drive Now, GreenMobility), can be used (e.g. to plan the balancing of the fleet in Copenhagen). Other data sources and applications can be incorporated into the project to further test the developed frameworks.

**This project is a partnership with the Technical University of Munich (TUM), particularly on the stochastic optimization component of the framework**.

**Closes September 15, 2018.**

This post-doctoral research study focuses on commuters cruising for parking, whose impact on traffic congestion is of first importance. In some cities, the time spent for searching a vacant parking spot can amount to 40% the total travel time, due to the limited parking spot availability and the uncoordinated objectives of commuters and suppliers. Hence, commuters’ parking is a challenging issue for transport system planners, operators and regulators.

Getting ever smarter, cities enable real time monitoring, analysis and improvement of citizens’ quality of life. Mobility data that are gathered by different platforms such as smart devices become real-time social observatories. They can help the dynamic modeling of transport infrastructure and facilities. They can help understanding how traffic congestion develops and evolves, unravelling hidden patterns and identifying models that can contribute to efficient traffic management techniques. Furthermore, mobility data make each user an actor as 'smart sensor’ and 'smart controller/decision maker', helping optimizing traffic network infrastructure facilities and improving cities’ mobility and accessibility.

Different control strategies were proposed to regulate the traffic flow through control variables such as variable parking price, variable toll fees and variable commuter departure time. The computation of these control variables generally relies on the observed statistics but do not reflect the actual traffic state at the given time. Hence the main objective of this study is to get profit of real time traffic state information and actual parking occupancy data in order to adjust the dynamic models that were obtained from data statistics, allowing coordinating commuters/drivers objectives so as to find available parking spots, minimizing the overall cruising-for-parking time and improving cities’ mobility and accessibility.

The socio-economic impact of traffic congestion in general, the challenges inherent to the related optimisation framework, and the modeling aspects impose a holistic view of the problem, addressed at several hierarchic levels. The continuous and discrete models and decision variables that are involved in the modeling render this optimization problem a mix integer-continuous one. The nature of the problem asks for modelings that carefully state the granularity levels in order to reach the necessary real time control properties.
