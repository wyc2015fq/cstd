## **1. 2018-2019 Herman Goldstine Postdoctoral Fellowship at IBM Research**

The Mathematical Sciences Department of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center invites applications for its 2018-2019 Herman Goldstine Memorial Postdoctoral Fellowship for research in mathematical and computer sciences. 

The fellowship provides scientists of outstanding ability an opportunity to advance their scholarship as resident department members at the Research Center. The department provides an atmosphere in which basic research is combined with work on technical problems arising in industry. Our permanent members, academic visitors, and post-doctoral fellows pursue research in pure and applied mathematics and in theoretical and exploratory computer science. 

Areas of research include: algorithms (approximation, randomized, and on-line); complex systems; data mining (machine learning, pattern recognition, computational statistics); dynamical systems; high-performance computing (scientific computing, parallel computing, big-data); inverse problems; numerical analysis; optimization (discrete, continuous, global and stochastic); **operations research**; probability theory (stochastic models, risk management, queues & queuing networks, simulation); and statistics (time-series, multivariate analysis, spatiotemporal analysis, design of experiments & reliability). 

Up to **two fellowships** will be awarded. The fellowship has a period of one year and may be extended another year by mutual agreement. The stipend is expected to be between **$130,000 and $150,000**, depending on the length of experience.

Applications will be accepted until Jan 16, 2018. Candidates must have received  a Ph.D. degree after September 2013 or should expect to receive one before the  fellowship commences in September 2018.

## **2. 15 Academic Positions at the University of Melbourne**

The University of Melbourne School of Computing and Information Systems is seeking applicants for 15 continuing (i.e. tenure-track / permanent ) Lecturer and Senior Lecturer positions. We seek dynamic academics with expertise in Computer Science or Information Systems who have the potential to build a stellar teaching and research career at Melbourne.

The School of Computing and Information Systems is an international research leader in computer science, information systems and software engineering. In this discipline, the School was ranked number 1 in Australia and 13th in the world in the 2016 QS World University Ranking exercise.

We are particularly seeking applicants with expertise in the areas of business information systems, health informatics/digital health, software engineering, cybersecurity, or high-performance and distributed systems, but applicants whose work is aligned with any of the research groups in the School are encouraged to apply.

Applications close on 15 Jan 2018. The positions are advertised at [http://go.unimelb.edu.au/jsp6](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url%3Fu%3Dhttp-3A__go.unimelb.edu.au_jsp6%26d%3DDwMF-g%26c%3DNgd-ta5yRYsqeUsEDgxhcqsYYY1Xs5ogLxWPA_2Wlc4%26r%3Ds_lxbKNFKI22hw_yzTQMWZWzcQCljwjWGnZOq6AD4Qo%26m%3DBKMbyKBlUnctCKtsZ7bpM3qXuIP92W8QUuyo965OrPc%26s%3DWaYqaT-xe7eIIaLDcdxYkQmu-AK8vniM2b6TU6sqzNg%26e%3D), where the formal position description and a brochure with more information are available.

## **3. Google AI Residency Program**

We invite applications to the Google AI Residency program, a one-year post-graduate program designed for exceptional students who wish to spend one year after their degree (PhD, MS, or BSc) to learn more about new advances in Machine Learning and perform top research in a related area. The program offers a unique opportunity for students in adjacent fields (e.g., CS theory, Math, OR) to gain exposure to an applied research area aligned with recent developments in machine learning.

The Google NYC Algorithms and Optimization team expects to host AI residents in various areas of data-driven optimization: optimization in ML, ML for market design, and graph-based learning. Students interested in working with our team in NYC may highlight this in their application and contact us for further guidelines. Further information about our team, including recent projects and publications, can be found at [https://research.google.com/teams/nycalg](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//research.google.com/teams/nycalg) .

The application deadline is January 8, 2018. See [g.co/airesidency](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//g.co/airesidency) for

more information about the program, and visit [g.co/airesidency/apply](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//g.co/airesidency/apply)
