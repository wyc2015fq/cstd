## **3、Three posts in deep learning for action recognition and prediction (Fabio Cuzzolin)**

The Visual Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Oxford Brookes University, led by Professor Fabio Cuzzolin, is seeking two (2) postdoctoral researchers (36 months) and one (1) research assistant (12months) in deep learning for action recognition and prediction, to start as soon as possible.

**The deadline for application is May 20 2018.**

The [Visual Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/FabioCuzzolin/) has established itself as one of the very top research groups in the world in deep learning for action detection, conducting work at the current boundaries of human action recognition. 

Our algorithms hold the best detection accuracies to date, and the team recently designed the only system so far able to localise multiple actions on the image plane in (better than) real time (52fps) on a single GPU.

Our work has won several awards in recent years. The team classified 2nd in both the [CVPR 2016 ActivityNet detection challenge](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//activity-net.org/challenges/2016/program.html%23leaderboard) and the [CVPR 2017 Charades challenge](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//vuchallenge.org/charades.html) , in collaboration with Disney Research, and behind Deepmind?s team Kinetics. We just published two works in this area at ICCV 2017, and are currently planning a number of PAMI and IJCV journal papers. Some former PhD students in the Lab have moved on to postdoc positions at Oxford, Stanford and ETH Zurich.

You will join a vibrant and fast growing team projected to comprise 18-20 people in 2018. You will be working on a network of cutting edge 4-GPU and 8-GPU workstations. The group collaborates with various companies including Huawei, BMW, NVIDIA, Cortexica and Sportlate, and is in the process of spinning off a company in the area of action detection. We closely work with Oxford Brookes. MOReS and the Cognitive Robotics research groups, as well as Oxford University’ s Torr Vision Group and Computer Science Department, and have established links with IIT Bombay, Harvard, Seoul National, and numerous European partners.

## **4、PhD positions at Technical University of Munich (Doctoral Program in Optimization and Networks)**

The doctoral program in Operations Research with focus on “Advanced Optimization in a Networked Economy“ funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) offers several positions for PhD students.

The challenges of a networked economy are fundamental and necessitate new theoretical and applied research. New computational techniques are needed to solve large-scale optimization problems and to handle large data sets; incentive structures have to be considered in situations with multiple decision makers; uncertainties and other dynamics in the parameters of resource allocation problems require new modeling tools and solution strategies. The research program focuses on important application-motivated projects that would benefit from new mathematical and analytical insights, including shared mobility, resource pooling, retail coordination, sales and operations planning, IT management, and airport operations.

Outstanding applicants with a background in mathematics, computer science, operations research, industrial engineering, or a related field will be offered a comprehensive study, training and research program. Specifically designed interdisciplinary projects will help to develop the ability to model, analyze, solve, and implement solutions for challenging real-world problems.  A detailed description of the projects, participating researchers and further information regarding the application process is available at our website: [http://www.gs.tum.de/adone/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.gs.tum.de/adone/)

**Application Process：**

Candidates are expected to hold a Master of Science degree (or, in exceptional cases, an excellent Bachelor degree) in one of the subject matters mentioned above and to have some experience with Operations Research methods. Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English are required.

We specifically encourage applications by qualified female researchers. Applicants with disabilities are treated with preference given comparable qualification.

For further information, please contact the RTG’s coordinator Dr. Yoshimi von Felbert (adone@tum.de<mailto:adone@tum.de >)

Please submit your complete application documents (as one pdf file) to adone@tum.de <mailto:adone@tum.de> **by June 1st, 2018**.
