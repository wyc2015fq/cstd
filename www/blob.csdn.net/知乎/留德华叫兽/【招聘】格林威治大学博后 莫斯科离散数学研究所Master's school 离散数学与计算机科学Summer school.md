## **学术招聘**

## **1.Postgraduate Research Scholarship at University of Greenwich (London)**

**Lead Supervisor and contact Email**:  **Dr Yong Lin (E-mail: Y.Lin@gre.ac.uk)**

**Project Title:**

Cultivating Sustainable Consumer Behaviours within the Sharing Economy: An Empirical Study of Bike-Sharing

**([https://docs.gre.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/1570167/Web-Advert-VCS-BUS-02-18.pdf](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//docs.gre.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/1570167/Web-Advert-VCS-BUS-02-18.pdf))**

**Project Description: **

-to explore consumer behaviour patterns and issues faced by emerging businesses, in particular bike-sharing;

-to explore both policy and operational solutions to cultivate consumer behaviours towards building a well-behaved city within the sharing economy. 

**Example：**

Bike-sharing.  In our case, how consumer be more considerate use of shared urban commodities and services and maximize the economic and mobility benefits from the bike sharing scheme. Meanwhile, how bike-sharing companies design pricing strategies and reward and incentive mechanisms, and how local authorities develop effective regulations and policies to cultivate and regulate customers’ consumption behaviours, are essential challenges to keep this innovative idea of sharing economy in a sustainable way for further development and improved processes. 

This research intents to tackle these challenges faced by bike-sharing, aim to explore solutions and recommendations to the stakeholders involved in the bike-sharing ecosystems in the UK, to facilitate its healthy implementation and development in cities/towns in the UK. 

**Bursary available** (subject to satisfactory performance): 

Year 1: £14,777 Year 2: In line with RCUK rate Year 3: In line with RCUK rate.

## **2.Master's School "Advanced Combinatorics"**

The Department of Discrete Mathematics of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology has recently launched a call for the Master's Program "Advanced Combinatorics": 

**[https://mipt.ru/education/chairs/dm/master-s-program-in-discrete-mathematics-2018.php](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//mipt.ru/education/chairs/dm/master-s-program-in-discrete-mathematics-2018.php)**

The topics covered include Combinatorics, Combinatorial Geometry, Game Theory, Discrete Analysis, Random Graphs, Analysis of Complex Networks and other interesting fields.

All courses are taught by leading MIPT professors: V.L. Dolnikov, A.Ya. Kanel-Belov, R.N. Karasev, A.M. Raigorodskii, D.A. Shabanov, I.D. Shkredov and others.

The program also features visiting lectures and mini-courses by top-tier experts in the field:

D. Gamarnik (MIT), G.O.H. Katona (Rényi Institute), J. Pach (EPFL), B. Sudakov (ETH Zurich), N. Litvak (Twente) and others.

Starting Date: October 1, 2018.

Program director: Prof. Andrei M. Raigorodskii

## **暑期学校**

## **1.Prague Summer School on Discrete Mathematics: registration closing soon**

Prague Summer School on Discrete Mathematics 2018 will take place from 16th to 20th July in the historical building of the Computer Science Department of Charles University. Piotr Micek (Jagiellonian University), Aleksandar Nikolov (University of Toronto), and Peter Pal Pach (Budapest University of Technology and Economics and University of Warwick) will give lecture courses on three topics in discrete mathematics. The School is primarily intended for PhD students and postdocs, but students and researchers in other stages of their careers may also participate. A limited number of stipends to cover travel and stay for participants is available.

More information is available at **[http://pssdm.math.cas.cz/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//pssdm.math.cas.cz/)** . 

**The deadline for registration is March 30, or until filled.**

## **2.5th Swedish Summer School in Computer Science **

The 5th Swedish Summer School in Computer Science (**[http://s3cs.eecs.kth.se/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//s3cs.eecs.kth.se/)** ) will be held August 5-11, 2018, in the beautiful Stockholm archipelago at Djuronaset (**[http://djuronaset.com/en/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//djuronaset.com/en/)** ). The school runs for a full week Monday-Friday in early August when Sweden is at its loveliest, with arrival on Sunday evening and departure Saturday morning.
We will celebrate our 5th anniversary by going significantly out of our comfort zone and learn about quantum computation. Ronald de Wolf (**[https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/)** ) will give a series of lectures accessible to people who do not know quantum from before. The idea is that this will help all those of us who routinely skip intimidating quantum talks at workshops and conference to overcome our deepest fears and learn enough so that during the next conference we can confidently go to the quantum sessions and actually understand some of what is going on (and maybe even ask a smart question or two).

Another reason for being scared about quantum is that the crypto systems we know and love might no longer be safe. But fear not: Oded Regev (**[https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//cims.nyu.edu/~regev/)**)  will give lectures on lattices and cryptography, explaining, among other things, how to survive in a post-quantum world. Other exciting topics that Oded will touch upon are the Learning with errors (LWE) problem and fully homomorphic encryption.

The summer school is primarily intended for PhD students, but postdocs and bright MSc students are also warmly welcome (and also faculty, subject to availability of slots).

The application deadline is April 20, 2018. Please see **[http://s3cs.eecs.kth.se/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//s3cs.eecs.kth.se/)**  for more information including instructions for how to apply. Any questions can be directed to **s3cs-2018@kth.se**.
