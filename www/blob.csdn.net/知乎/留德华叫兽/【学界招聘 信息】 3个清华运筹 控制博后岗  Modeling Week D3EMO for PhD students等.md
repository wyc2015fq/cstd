## **2、Seven PhD positions at GRK 2088 at the University of Göttingen**

The Research Training Group RTG 2088 “Discovering Structure in Complex Data: Statistics meets Optimization and Inverse Problems”(Speaker: Prof. Gerlind Plonka-Hoch) at the Georg-August-University Göttingen offers positions for 7 Ph.D. candidates beginning on October 1st, 2018. The salary is in accordance with the German public service salary scale (E13 TV-L) with 75% of the regular working hours (currently 29.85 hours per week) for up to three years.

The research projects in this RTG focus on new mathematical concepts for the efficient reconstruction and classification of relevant structural information in data sets, without reconstructing the entire information inherent in the data. Methodologically, specific emphasis will be laid upon the interplay between approaches in statistics, optimization and inverse problems.

**Requirements:**

- A very good M.Sc.degree (or equivalent) in mathematics or a similar field;

- A strong background in one of the mathematical disciplines covered by the RTG (inverse problems, optimization, mathematical statistics, data analysis, probability theory, computational topology, mathematical signal and image processing);

- Proficiency in written and spoken English;

- Good programming skills are beneficial.

The University of Göttingen is an equal opportunities employer and places particular emphasis on fostering career opportunities for women. Qualified women are therefore strongly encouraged to apply. The university has committed itself to being a family-friendly institution. Applications from severely disabled persons with equivalent qualifications will be given preference.

The job description can be found at [http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/305402.html?cid=100349](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.uni-goettingen.de/de/305402.html%3Fcid%3D100349)

Detailed information on the application process, the research projects and the PhD study program are available at [http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/514290.html.](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.uni-goettingen.de/de/514290.html) Candidates are required to indicate up to three preferred projects.

## **3、2 Research Assistant Positions, Applied Mathematics**

The Institute of Applied Mathematics invites applications for two positions as a Research Assistant (m/f) (Salary Scale 13 TV-L 75%) to be appointed the latest on October 1st 2018. The positions are initially limited to 3 years each. Candidates will have the opportunity to work towards a doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics (Dr. rer. nat.).

Responsibilities and duties include research in the Numerics of PDE's, Finite Elements under supervision of Prof. Sven Beuchler, and a teaching load of three hours a week. To qualify for the position, applicants must hold a Master's degree in Mathematics. In addition, an advanced knowledge of partial differential equations and programming as can be acquired through a Master's thesis in the subject and through advanced courses in areas such as Computational Mathematics and Scientific Computing. The ability to communicate on scientific topics in English is essential. Part-time employment is possible. As an equal opportunities employer, the Leibniz Universitat Hannover intends to promote women and men in the context of statutory requirements. For this reason suitably qualified women are specifically invited to apply. Equally qualified applicants with disabilities will be given preferential treatment.

For further information, please contact Prof. Sven Beuchler who will be pleased to assist.

## **4、Modeling Week D3EMO @ CPH (for PhD students)**

REMINDER: **Deadline June 25, 2018**

Application window open for PhD students to be admitted to D3EMO

**D3EMO:** Modeling Week on Data Driven Decision Making and Optimization September 3-7, 2018 @ Copenhagen Business School

**Sponsors:** MI-NET COST Action TD1409, EURO General Support Fund, Copenhagen Business School  [https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-economics/events/d3emo-modeling-week](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-economics/events/d3emo-modeling-week)

D3EMO Modeling Week will admit PhD students on a competitive basis, to work on problems proposed by industry. **The PhD students will be required to have expertise in Mathematical Optimization, Operations Research or Statistical Data Analysis**. Mathematical models and numerical solution approaches will be developed and communicated, following a collaborative approach, in which the PhD students will work in small groups under the supervision of the senior researchers during the Modeling Week.  D3EMO Modeling Week is a natural place for PhD students to acquire advanced mathematical modeling training given by experts in the area, as well as contributing to their career development training (both for academic and non-academic progression) by developing further their collaborating and communication skills.

**PhD students are applying to be admitted to the modeling week**. The applications will be reviewed by the committee and those successful students will be notified by the end of June. The committee will consider (amongst other criteria): the excellence of the student, the area they are working in and the benefit to the student of attending the modeling week. Those PhD students admitted will receive a personal grant to (partially) **cover accommodation, travel and meals**.

To apply, please follow the link <Apply for D3EMO 2018,[https://goo.gl/forms/TwvvP0x7gy6133Rd2](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//goo.gl/forms/TwvvP0x7gy6133Rd2) >, and enter the requested fields, including the uploading of three files with
- Your University level qualifications
- CV containing a brief description of your PhD project, and details of your supervisor, institution, year of study, prizes or awards received, and poster/oral presentations delivered
- A letter of motivation for wanting to attend the modeling week
