## 1. Open PhD position in Network Algorithms at the University ofVienna（奥地利）

see below and at:

[https://tinyurl.com/y7t3bcy2](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//tinyurl.com/y7t3bcy2) <[https://tinyurl.com/y9plkw5b](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//tinyurl.com/y9plkw5b)>

for more details.

The specific topic will depend on the interests and skills of the student,
and could revolve around e.g., self-adjusting networks, online graph
partitioning, graph embedding (“virtual network embedding”),
(semi-)oblivious routing, routing table compression, or self-stabilizing
algorithms. Similarly, the methodology will depend on the student and
includes graph algorithms, online algorithms, approximation algorithms,
learning algorithms, linear programming and randomized rounding, as well as
computer-generated algorithms. See below some example papers.

For an overview of our research group as well as publications, see

## 2. PhD position in carsharing optimization at Linköping University（瑞典）

The research group for quantitative logistics at Linköping University is expanding its research and searches for a new PhD student.

The group is part of the Division for Communication and Transport Systems, with over 70 staff members studying transport and communication networks in the broadest sense. Many projects aim at developing models and methods for traffic systems, which can be used as decision support tools by infrastructure managers, operators, vehicle drivers and others.

At the Department of Science and Technology, at the university’s Norrköping Campus, we provide education and conduct research in physics and electronics, communications/logistics and media- and information technology. The department is recognised for its work in fields including logistics, visualisation and organic electronics. We combine academic excellence with fruitful collaboration with the Community.

Your research will be conducted within the research project NEtworK Optimization for CarSharing Integration into a Multimodal TRANSportation System (EkoCS-Trans). The overall goal of this project is to support Swedish industry in providing CS solutions that attract a wide customer base (and, hence, lead to a reduced energy consumption), and to enable Swedish authorities to account for growing CS in their strategic urban transport planning. The approach is quantitative and makes strong use of simulation and optimization techniques.

On the simulation side, you will be responsible for integrating a representation of shared vehicles into an existing multi-agent transport simulation for Stockholm. On the optimization side, you will be responsible for solving problems that are mainly related to the planning of car sharing systems, using for example mathematical optimization or geometric algorithms. You will also contribute to the integration of both aspects of your research into a simulation-based optimization approach for the planning of car sharing systems.

The research is carried out together with VTI, the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute and stakeholders from industry and society.

We wish you have programming skills in Java or strong programming skills in some other object-oriented language. You should have strong quantitative skills/theoretical/mathematical background, e.g. through a degree in computer science, mathematics, physics, engineering (or willingness to learn). Moreover, you have an interest in applying quantitative and computational techniques to real transportation problems, and have good command of spoken and written English.
Additionally desirable are a transportation related background (e.g. a degree in (intelligent) transportation systems or the like), knowledge of algorithm design or mathematical optimization, an interest in interdisciplinary cooperation, communication and team skills, and creativity.

We hope to fill the position by spring 2019.

## 3. Postdoc positions in SAT solving at KTH Royal Institute of Technology（瑞典）

The TCS Group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology invites applications for postdoc positions in computer science focused on algorithms for solving the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) very efficiently for large classes of instances, and on analyzing and understanding such algorithms.

KTH Royal Institute of Technology is the leading technical university in Sweden. The Theoretical Computer Science Group at KTH ([www.kth.se/tcs](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.kth.se/tcs)) offers a strong research environment spanning a wide range of research topics such as complexity theory and approximation algorithms, computer and network security, cryptography, formal methods and natural language processing. We have one of Europe's most prominent groups in algorithms and complexity theory, and the research conducted here has attracted numerous international awards and grants in recent years.

The postdoctoral researchers will be working in the research group of Jakob Nordstrom. Much of the activities of this research group revolve around the themes of efficient algorithms for satisfiability in propositional logic (SAT solving) and lower bounds on the efficiency of methods for reasoning about SAT (proof complexity). On the practical side, one problem of interest is to gain a better understanding of, and improve, the performance of current state-of-the-art SAT solvers based on conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL). We are even more interested in exploring new algebraic or geometric techniques (such as Groebner bases or pseudo-Boolean solving) that could potentially yield exponential improvements over CDCL. We also believe that there should be ample room for technology transfer with related areas such as SMT solving, constraint programming, and/or mixed integer linear programming, and so excellent researchers in these areas are also warmly welcome to apply.

A more detailed description of the project can be found at [www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/project-proofcplx](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/project-proofcplx). The group currently consists of 4 postdoctoral researchers and 4 PhD students (in addition to the PI). There are also several other professors, postdocs, and PhD students in the TCS Group working on other aspects of algorithms and computational complexity, and so this is a unique opportunity to explore new connections between theoretical and practical areas of computer science within a vibrant and growing research environment.

Within the overall framework sketched above, the postdocs will be expected and encouraged to contribute to and influence the research agenda. Taking part in teaching graduate seminar courses is encouraged but not required. Travel funding is included, and the group also receives short-term and long-term visitors on a regular basis.

These postdoc positions are full-time employed positions for one year with a possible (and expected) one-year extension. The expected starting date is in August-September 2019, although this is to some extent negotiable.

The application deadline is February 4, 2019. See[http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/J-2018-3178-Eng.php](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/J-2018-3178-Eng.php)for the full announcement with more information and instructions how to apply. Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to[jakobn@kth.se](mailto:jakobn@kth.se)
