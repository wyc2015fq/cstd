PhD and Postdoc positions KU Leuven: Optimization frameworks for deep kernel machines 

The research group KU Leuven ESAT-STADIUS is currently offering **2 PhD and 1 Postdoc (1 year, extendable) positions** within the framework of the KU Leuven C1 project Optimization frameworks for deep kernel machines (promotors: Prof. Johan Suykens and Prof. Panos Patrinos).

Deep learning and kernel-based learning are among the very powerful methods in machine learning and data-driven modelling. From an optimization and model representation point of view, training of deep feedforward neural networks occurs in a primal form, while kernel-based learning is often characterized by dual representations, in connection to possibly infinite dimensional problems in the primal. In this project we aim at investigating new optimization frameworks for deep kernel machines, with feature maps and kernels taken at multiple levels, and with possibly different objectives for the levels. The research hypothesis is that such an extended framework, including both deep feedforward networks and deep kernel machines, can lead to new important insights and improved results. In order to achieve this, we will study optimization modelling aspects (e.g. variational principles, distributed learning formulations, consensus algorithms), accelerated learning schemes and adversarial learning methods. 

The PhD and Postdoc positions in this KU Leuven C1 project (promotors: Prof. Johan Suykens and Prof. Panos Patrinos) relate to the following possible topics: 

-1- Optimization modelling for deep kernel machines 

-2- Efficient learning schemes for deep kernel machines 

-3- Adversarial learning for deep kernel machines

## **3、Postdoc Positions in Machine Learning at TU Kaiserslautern**
![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-0abf0b3591ba19d6f8a73375fea742f0_b.jpg)
Multiple Postdoc and PhD positions in Statistical Machine Learning at the Machine Learning Group, Department of Computer Science, TU Kaiserslautern 

**※ Deadline: none (asap) ※**

The machine learning group at the Department of Computer Science at TU Kaiserslautern (headed by Prof. Marius Kloft,（[http://ml.informatik.uni-kl.de/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//ml.informatik.uni-kl.de/)） is recruiting highly-motivated doctoral and postdoctoral researchers. 

**※ MEET ME AT ICML 2018 ※ **

I am at ICML right now. One of the best ways to inquire about the job is to meet me at ICML. E.g., you can meet me at our posters 54 and 147 or contact me via *Whova*. 

**※ ABOUT THE GROUP ※ **

The group develops theoretically grounded statistical machine learning methods for analysis of big data. The group has developed effective learning methods and statistical learning theory for learning using multiple representations (multiple kernel learning) or multiple learning tasks (multi-task learning) as well as anomaly detection. 

The group has successfully applied these methods in various application domains, including network intrusion detection (Remind system), visual image recognition (ImageClef Challenge winner), computational biology (most accurate gene start finder), computational medicine (most accurate drug sensitivity predictor) and plant breeding. 

The group regularly publishes on the above topics at conferences such as NIPS, ICML, AISTATS, and ECML, as well as in journals such as JMLR and MLJ. 

The group's most recent research focuses on deep learning of multiple data representations, deep anomaly detection, large-scale Bayesian methods and extreme classification (multi-class learning using an extremely large number of label classes). 

**※ THE LOCATION ※ **

Kaiserslautern is one of the major locations of AI and ML research in Germany, with its Department of Computer Science and the German National Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, as well as the Deep Learning Competence Center. 

The Kaiserslautern-Saarbrücken Computer Science Cluster is one of the major locations in Germany for computer science research, comprising about 800 CS researchers in two universities and ten research institutes (including two Max-Planck and two Fraunhofer institutes). 

**※ HOW TO APPLY ※  **
