## **2、Postdoc position in machine learning at EPFL Data Science Lab, Switzerland(Robert West)**

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in the EPFL Data Science Lab ([https://dlab.epfl.ch](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//dlab.epfl.ch)) in Switzerland, headed by Prof. Robert West. **The ideal start is early 2019. The position will be for a period of one to two years**. 

**DESCRIPTION **

Research in the EPFL Data Science Lab aims to make sense of large amounts of data. Frequently, the data we analyze is collected on the Web, e.g., using server logs, social media, wikis, online news, online games, etc. We distill heaps of raw data into meaningful insights and useful applications by developing and applying algorithms and techniques in the field of data science, broadly construed, at the crossroads of social and information network analysis, machine learning, computational social science, data mining, and natural language processing. 

The Lab was founded in late 2016 and is currently in a phase of rapid and enthusiastic growth. Therefore, candidates must be highly motivated to actively participate in building the Lab and shaping its future direction. The successful candidate will be an engine, rather than a cog in the machine. They will advance the visibility of the Lab by advancing their own visibility. They will lead innovative research projects in a stimulating, open, and international research environment consisting of many highly talented and motivated students, embedded in a strong network of academic and industrial collaborators. 

Other benefits include a competitive salary (around CHF 82,000 p.a.), an extremely well funded national research system, an office next to a stunning lake and even more stunning mountains, and generous travel support (in order to see something less stunning once in a while). 

There are no teaching requirements (except the occasional stand-in when Prof. West is traveling). 

**QUALIFICATIONS **

Candidates should have completed, or be near completion of, a PhD with a strong international publication record in areas such as (but not limited to) machine learning, data mining, social network analysis, network science, computational social science, natural language processing, information retrieval, etc. The successful candidate will do innovative and creative work in the space spanned by these bases, and the potential to do so counts more than the exact coordinates in this space. Strong programming skills are required. 

**ABOUT EPFL **

EPFL ranks among the world’s top universities in the field of computer science. It is located in Lausanne, Switzerland, a beautiful and vibrant city in an Alpine setting on the shores of scenic Lake Geneva, in the very heart of Europe. English is the main language spoken at EPFL, and Lausanne is highly international, such that no French language skills are required. 

**HOW TO APPLY **

Please follow the instructions here:
