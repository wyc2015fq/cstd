玛丽居里项目（MSCA）是由欧盟/欧盟委员会为支持欧洲研究区（ERA）研究而创建的一系列流动研究资助项目。 欧盟研究执行机构（REA）已投入超过60亿欧元用于MarieSkłodowska-Curie行动。 自1996年该计划启动以来，已有超过100,000名研究人员在2017年3月之前获得了MSCA资助。该项目主要适用于想要前往欧洲进行博士、博士后以及更高层次研究的学者。

## **玛丽居里项目（MSCA）**

**博士、博后、高层次学者**

玛丽居里项目（MSCA）是由欧盟/欧盟委员会为支持欧洲研究区（ERA）研究而创建的一系列流动研究资助项目。 欧盟研究执行机构（REA）已投入超过60亿欧元用于MarieSkłodowska-Curie行动。 自1996年该计划启动以来，已有超过100,000名研究人员在2017年3月之前获得了MSCA资助。该项目主要适用于想要前往欧洲进行博士、博士后以及更高层次研究的学者。

欧盟玛丽居里项目分为 ITN, IF, RISE, COFUND. (详情见：More Infomations)。 其中，ITN 项目支持的是欧洲高校、研究机构、非学术机构联合参与的培训或博士培养项目，不仅包含学术，也提供学术外的经历，增强参与者的创新和就业能力。

本文所介绍的POEMA (Polynomial Optimization, Efficiency through Moments and Algebra) 属于 ITN 项目(2019-2022)。POEMA将提供全欧洲范围内从2019年9月开始的15个博士职位。

在 Available positions责编收集了官方发布的各个博士职位的研究课题以及相关指导教授信息。

## **Position Description**

POEMA is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network funded by the European Union. Its goal is to train scientists at the interplay of algebra, geometry and computer science for polynomial optimization problems and to foster scientific and technological advances, stimulating interdisciplinary and intersectoriality knowledge exchange between algebraists, geometers, computer scientists and industrial actors facing real-life optimization problems.

On the subject of Polynomial Optimization, Efficiency through Moments and Algebra at eleven European Research Institutes and Universitites.

The Innovative Training Network POEMA is hiring 15 Doctoral Students starting from September 2019. The proposed projects will be investigating the development of new algebraic and geometric methods combined with computer algebra techniques for global non-linear optimization problems. Applications will focus on smarter cities challenges, urban traffic management, water network management, energy flow control, or environmental monitoring.

## **Qualifications**
- Have — **at the date of recruitment** — a Master’s degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or Engineering (or any equivalent diploma).
- Should have — at the date of recruitment — less than 4 years of a research career, and not have a doctoral degree. The 4 years are measured from the date when they obtained the degree which would formally entitle them to embark on a PhD, either in the country where the degree was obtained or in the country where the PhD is provided.
- **Trans-national mobility: **The applicant — **at the date of recruitment** — should not have resided in the country where the research training takes place for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately prior to recruitment, and not have carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in that country. For refugees under the Geneva Convention  (1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol), the refugee procedure (i.e. before refugee status is conferred) will not be counted as ‘period of  residence/activity in the country of the beneficiary’.
- Be able to communicate fluently in English (speaking and writing). Oral interview with the prospective advisor may be required.

**Note:** A Master's degree (or equivalent) is not necessary at the time of the application, but will be required at the date of recruitment (in September or October).

## **Application Details**

**Submission deadline : March 15, 2019**

To apply for one of these positions, you need following materials which is a single pdf document. **Applying Link, please see**More Informations.
- a detailed CV including education, work experience, skills, dissertations, research interests, career objectives, and — **if available at the date of submission** — names and contact details of two referees, that can include the supervisor of the master thesis, willing to provide confidential letters of recommendation, a list of publications if any;
- a letter of motivation regarding the position as well as the POEMA network;
- a transcript of the master studies’ grades (including the overall grade and an explanation of the grading system) and the master’s thesis **if available**;
- **and indicate as TITLE your full name,  add 3 KEYWORDS,  and chose the TOPICS you are interested in (ALL, ESR1, ..., ESR15).**

## **Salary**

A competitive gross salary of 3,270 €/month, adjusted for their host country, a Mobility Allowance of 600 €/month and, for researchers who have a family, a Family Allowance of 500 €/month. All amounts are subject to deductions and taxes. Family is defined as persons linked to the researcher by (i) marriage, or (ii) a relationship with equivalent status to a marriage recognised by the national legislation of the  country of the beneficiary or of nationality of the researcher, or (iii) dependent children who are actually being maintained by the researcher; family status is determined at recruitment and does not evolve.
