## **1、Call for Papers for Special Issue on Optimization Models and Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence**

*Journal of the Operations Research Society of China*

**Call for Papers for Special Issue on Optimization Models and Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence**

Scope: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications are the hottest topic in recent years, while the optimization architecture is one of its key contents. In fact, the typical AI model is always represented by minimizing or maximizing a certain objective/energy function. Therefore, an optimization model with a fast and robust algorithm is meaningful for AI researches.

Under such circumstances, the aim of this special issue is to solicit the state-of-the-art models and algorithms for AI, especially for machine learning, which is benefit for some interesting applications in image processing and analysis, computer-aided diagnosing, autonomous robot, intelligent manufacture, traffic flow, social network analysis, etc. The issue will also provide a convincing forum for researchers and practitioners to disseminate their latest research results.

The special issue seeks for original contribution of works which addresses the challenges from the optimization models and algorithms for AI as well as some interesting applications, such as medical image analysis, autonomous robot, intelligent manufacture, traffic flow, and social network analysis, etc. 

**Specific topics include, but not limited to, the following:**
- Continuous optimization models for machine learning 
- Continuous optimization algorithms for machine learning
- Discrete optimization for machine learning
- Complexity analysis for machine learning algorithms
- Theoretical issues and applications related to big data and deep learning
- Applications in image processing and analysis, computer-aided diagnosing, autonomous robot, intelligent manufacture, traffic flow, social network analysis, etc.

All submissions must be original and can not be under review by another publication. A submission based on one or more papers that appeared elsewhere has to comprise major value-added extensions over what appeared previously (at least 30% new material). Authors are requested to attach to the submitted paper their relevant, previously published articles and a summary document explaining the enhancements made in the journal version.

## **3、Call for submissions to the CP2018 Doctoral Program (Travel Fund)**

The Doctoral Program (DP) of the CP conference is open to all students doing research on constraints, including students that participated in previous DPs. It is a place where you can meet other student researchers, discuss your ongoing work in a relaxed atmosphere, as well as getting some mentoring from an experienced researcher in the field.

You can participate by submitting a paper about your ongoing research, or just the abstract if you have a paper accepted at the main conference; see below for detailed instructions. Any participating student can also request financial support to have the registration fee waived. We also propose inexpensive quality shared accommodation to participating students on a first-come first-served basis.

The program is a full-day event at the conference and includes presentations of the papers, a poster session for all CP attendees, mentoring by a senior researcher who will see your talk and spend some time to discuss with you during the conference, as well as a nice (and free) dinner at the end of the day.

**Important dates**

   - June 5, 2018 - Paper submission deadline

   - June 7, 2018 - Financial support request deadline

   - June 27, 2018 - Notification

   - July 11, 2018 - Camera ready version for online proceedings

   - August 27, 2018 - Doctoral program

**Submission instructions**

Any student who does research on constraints (in the broadest sense) can participate. The submitted paper should contain work that is primarily the work of the student. It can be work in progress, completed work, or recently published work.

Students with a paper accepted at CP 2018 can participate by submitting just the abstract of the paper. They will also present at the doctoral program, but in lightning talk format (~3 minutes).

All other students are required to submit a short paper (from 4 to 8 pages, excluding references).

Submissions should be in the same style as the main conference ([Springer LNCS](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.springer.com/computer/lncs%3FSGWID%3D0-164-6-793341-0)), and the author list should specify who is the student and who are the advisors and other co-authors. Submissions are required to be in **PDF format**. All proposals should be submitted online through [Easy-Chair](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//easychair.org/conferences/%3Fconf%3Ddpcp18) by selecting *"New Submission"*.

**Financial Support**

Participants of the doctoral program can ask for financial support, which consists of a reduced registration fee including rooms.

To request financial support, you should send a mail to dpcp2018 at [http://gmail.com](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//gmail.com) until June 7, 2018, with your advisor in CC, containing:

   Your name and affiliation.

   Title and ID of your submission.

   Name of your advisor (he/she should be in CC of the email as well).

A PDF containing: a short motivation of your request (is it primarily your work, how can the support help you and your lab, optionally whether the support is essential for participating in the conference) and a signature of you and your advisor.

We have funding to support up to 30 students. This will be allocated based on the motivation of the request, and in case of ties on the quality of the submitted work.

Doctoral Program Review training on submitting a paper, you will be assigned another student's paper to review. This is both to let you practice reviewing, and to share your impressions of the work with the other student. If your own submission is accepted, your mentor (see below) will discuss your review with you during the conference.

**Presentation**

All students will be asked to present their work at the doctoral program. The presentation will be about 15 minutes long, followed by an open discussion. If you submitted an abstract of a paper accepted at CP, the presentation will be a short 3 minute lighting talk, meant to motivate the students to come see your full presentation.

**Invited talks**

We are delighted to announce the following invited speakers at the Doctoral Program:

[Claude-Guy Quimper](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~quimper/). "*Improving the Energetic Reasoning: How I followed 15-year-old advice from my supervisor.*"

[Lakhdar Sais](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~sais/). "*Towards cross-fertilization between Data Mining and Constraints.*"

**Poster session**

There will be a poster session for the doctoral program participants, where all attendees of the main conference can come and see your work (exact details to be determined).

**Social dinner**

There will be a free dinner on the evening of the doctoral program, open to all students selected for the doctoral program, the doctoral program invited speakers and chairs.

**Cheap shared accommodation**

Any participating student can register for a free accommodation at conference registration time. We have indeed reserved 30 free student single rooms (bathroom included) in a good quality residence[http://www.crous-lille.fr/logement/residence-albert-camus/](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.crous-lille.fr/logement/residence-albert-camus/) .
