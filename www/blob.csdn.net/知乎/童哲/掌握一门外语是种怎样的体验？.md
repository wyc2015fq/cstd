How does it feel like to be able to speak a different language?

When you are watching an imported drama, how does it feel like if you see foreign actors speaking in your language (dubbed)?

For me, it made the entire show strange,  i prefer subtitle than dubbing. 

Because actors actual voices reveal their personality, culture, and their emotion perfectly.   

When you listening to foreign music, i.e K-pop, J-pop, how do you feel when you are deeply touched by the song?

You wish you could sing along~

Communicating with foreigners in their language would have widen your vision, and their experience might inspire you in many different levels.   

Foreign language could enlighten us and create a whole different world for us.

无需怕难、怕没有语言天赋

世界上大部分的语言是表音文字，学会字母就可以开始拼读
