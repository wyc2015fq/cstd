偶然看到Carroll（爱丽丝她爹）的一则日记，列一个写作计划（March 29th -- Never before have I had so many **literary projects** on hand at once. For curiosity, I will here make a list of them.），多数是要写给小朋友的（包括趣味数学）——



(1) Supplement to "Euclid and Modern Rivals."

(2) 2nd Edition of "Euc. and Mod. Rivals."

(3) A book of Math. curiosities, which I think of calling "**Pillow Problems, and other Math. Trifles.**" This will contain Problems worked out in the dark, Logarithms without Tables, Sines and angles do., a paper I am now writing on "**Infinities and Infinitesimals**," condensed **Long Multiplication**, and perhaps others. 

(4) Euclid V. 

(5) "Plain Facts for Circle-Squarers," which is nearly complete, and gives actual proof of limits 3.14158, 3.14160. 

(6) A symbolical Logic, treated by my algebraic method. 

(7) "A Tangled Tale." 

(8) A collection of Games and Puzzles of my devising, with fairy pictures by Miss E.G. Thomson. This might also contain my "Mem. Tech." for dates; my "Cipher-writing" scheme for Letter-registration, &c., &c. 

(9) Nursery Alice. 

(10) Serious poems in "Phantasmagoria." 

(11) "**Alice****'s Adventures Underground.**" 

(12) "Girl's Own Shakespeare." I have begun on "Tempest." 

(13) New edition of "Parliamentary Representation." 

(14) New edition of Euc. I., II. 

(15) The new child's book, which **Mr. Furniss** is to illustrate. I have settled on no name as yet, but it will perhaps be "Sylvie and Bruno." I have other shadowy ideas, e.g., a Geometry for Boys, a vol. of Essays on theological points freely and plainly treated, and a drama on "Alice" (for which Mr. Mackenzie would write music): but the above is a fair example of "**too many irons in the fire**!" 



***Euclid and Modern Rivals***是一本有趣的几何，如今还有再版，跟着的几种我没见过，看题目应该有意思（也许除了那个符号逻辑的）；第11种当然最有名，第12本令人想起Lamb姐弟的莎士比亚故事（也是从暴风雨写起），不知老卡会写成什么可爱的样子。
