刚收到一封来自Elsevier的信，提醒大家不要被某些fraudulent emails欺骗了。虽然我还没有收到过信中所说的那类诈骗邮件，还是遵照Elsevier的意思。把下面的警告信贴出来，真的收到过信的老师和同学们也就心中有数了。





Dear Prof Yong



As you may already be aware, fraudulent e-mail solicitations for scholarly papers, scholarship applications and reviewer details have been circulating which claim to originate from Elsevier. These e-mails are directed to prospective authors, reviewers and editors, and often request payment and personal details. 



We are concerned about these e-mails and want to alert you to this. We also want to protect our community as well as helping you to recognize fraudulent and/or phishing emails. 



Quick tips on how to recognize an email from Elsevier:  

> 
• **We do not use other free third-party e-mail providers in communications with reviewers,  authors and editors **



•** We have a secure online submission system - EES**



• **The majority (95% +) of our journals do not charge handling fees**



• **We do not request registration fees from reviewers**




The fraudulent e-mail messages currently in circulation, generally contain "Editorial/Reviewer Appointment", "Elsevier Scholarships", "Manuscript Submission" or "Call for Papers" in the subject line and are typically sent using e-mail accounts supported by Gmail, Hotmail or by other free e-mail providers. Typically, the body of these messages either contain a request for $100 to register as a reviewer/editor, or a "Call for Papers" requesting that authors submit scholarly articles via e-mail for publication by Elsevier in various Elsevier journals and other publications. Ultimately, these fraudulent e-mails involve a request for the victims to send "fees" to cover the processing of the article that has been submitted, or registering as a reviewer/editor. 



Please be assured that Elsevier, is in no way associated with this fraudulent e-mail campaign. Elsevier is currently investigating this fraud to identify the persons responsible and to bring them to justice. Please help us to protect and inform the community by forwarding this e-mail to your colleagues. 



**In addition, please be advised that Elsevier does not solicit intellectual property in this fashion, and does not utilize Gmail, Hotmail, or any other free third-party e-mail providers in communications with reviewers, authors and editors.**



If you receive any e-mail messages that appear to be a part of this fraudulent solicitation, **DO NOT respond to the message and do not open any attachments contained in the message. Rather, please forward the message to Elsevier's Fraud Department at emailabuse@elsevier.com.** We will use the information included in the message to aid in our investigation. If you know of someone who has received this message, please pass along the above information and ask them also to forward the message to the Elsevier's Fraud Department. 



Thank you for your understanding and your cooperation. 



Kind regards,
