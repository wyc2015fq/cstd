Jobs像“姗姗”一样迟来了一个星期，还没看呢；却看见他的妹妹**Mona Simpson**（小说家，洛杉矶加州大学英语教授）10月16日在斯坦福大学纪念教堂发表的纪念讲话：**A Sister’s Eulogy for Steve Jobs**——后来发表在《纽约时报》（[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opinion/mona-simpsons-eulogy-for-steve-jobs.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opinion/mona-simpsons-eulogy-for-steve-jobs.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all)）。



妹妹25岁才见到失散多年的哥哥（Jobs寻亲和认亲的故事，见新书的第20章，与妹妹相认的细节，与这儿略有出入）。**I don’t remember much of what we said that first day, only that he felt like someone I’d pick to be a friend**. 她在文章里回忆了对哥哥的印象，有几个标题式的句子也许可以拿来概括一个多面的苹果人：



**Steve worked at what he loved. He worked really hard. Every day. **



**He didn’t favor trends or gimmicks. He liked people his own age.**



**He was willing to be misunderstood. **



**He believed that love happened all the time, everywhere. In that most important way, Steve was never ironic, never cynical, never pessimistic. I try to learn from that, still. **



**Steve was humble. Steve liked to keep learning. **



**Steve cultivated whimsy. What other C.E.O. knows the history of English and Chinese tea roses and has a favorite David Austin rose?【David C.H. Austin 是园艺家和作家，养过很多有名的玫瑰。】**



**Even ill, his taste, his discrimination and his judgment held. He went through 67 nurses before finding kindred spirits and then he completely trusted the three who stayed with him to the end. Tracy. Arturo. Elham. **



**Yet, what amazed me, and what I learned from his illness, was how much was still left after so much had been taken away. **



她还记录了Jobs的最后时刻：



**Before embarking, he’d looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life’s partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. **

**Steve’s final words were: **



**OH WOW. OH WOW. OH WOW. **



我印象最深的一句话是：乔老爷的最大价值不在新，而在美——

Novelty was not Steve’s highest value. Beauty was. 



他的美学观，像妹妹引用的一句话，是要让美超越时尚的新鲜而达到艺术的持久：**“Fashion is what seems beautiful now but looks ugly later; art can be ugly at first but it becomes beautiful later.” **



**Steve always aspired to make beautiful later. **



我们现在大讲“创新”，似乎已经忘了还有“美”——很多五花八门的“新”成了笑话、谎言或丑闻，就是因为它们在任何时候、任何意义上都不美。
