J.L., 

Thanks for your prompt reply and your promise of not discouraging.

I knew the reaction would be unbelievable and unacceptable as I said: “我知道这篇小品提出的命题令人难以相信和接受” It is good!

However, could you tell me what was wrong there? May be the Vectors Multiplicative Group does not stand. But why? Or, Is there already an opposite conclusion? I could not find the opposite evidence myself. 

**Instead, I have found a supporting statement: “****一切元在数域*****F*****中的*****n*****阶可逆矩阵对于矩阵的乘法****组成一个群，记作*GLn*(*F*)****。”** [1]

I translate it as follow: 

An *n*-dimensional reversible matrix, all its elements on field *F*, makes a multiplicative Group, noted as *GLn*(*F*).   

The Set of reversible matrix includes diagonal matrix. Thus, diagonal matrix is a multiplicative Group. Furthermore, component wise multiplicative vectors is a Group, too. Diagonal matrix is nothing else but an *m*-vectors. So, all the reasoning comes from the definition of component-wise vectors multiplication. If the component-wise vectors multiplication stands, then just like diagonal matrix, *m*-vectors is a Group, no doubt. **Reversible matrix ****Є Diagonal matrix, but Diagonal matrix = *m*-vectors.**

In reply, you have mentioned the “big data analysis (大数据分析)”, also in our second meeting back on last September. **How do I access Big Data****？**I don’t know the exact definition of “big data”. But, the stock market data are the “variables-by-samples-by-times data”. It called “three-way-data” by Gauch [2]. It translated into Chinese as Three Subscripts Data, *D*(*i,j,k*), *i*=1,2,…*m*, *j*=1,2,…*n*, and *k*=0,1,2,…. , or Crystal Matrix (”三向数据”, “三下标数据”，或”晶阵”). Are they not a “big data”? Or could you tell me where I can get a multivariate time series “Big Data”, other than stock market?  Please keep it in mind that my research is to find the system transition trends ***T***(*k*), from existing history data: ***D***(*k*)****T***(*k*)=***D***(*k*+1). 

Thank you for your reply rising more valuable discussions. 

Have a nice weekend and talk to you later,



Jay, **4/12/2018**
