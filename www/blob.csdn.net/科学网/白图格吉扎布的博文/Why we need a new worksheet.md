**Thanks for JP‘ email. Her email broughta very good question.**

**Why we need a new worksheet**



We have been a very successful year of 2017: after three months paper trading, we formed the first COLO Group and registered with Colorado state and invested into Fidelity mutual fundsmarket. The investment works so well, it makes everyone happy. We decided to go further to more people to let them share the important scientific research results. We are trying to attract more people,  to form their own investment clubs, let them to help me to further test the MDSM. The new people are yong and with more professional backgrounds: financial, math, or computers.... Thus, we need a new worksheet for them. 

The new worksheet will use the stock market, instead of mutual funds. Mutual funds are free trading, thus they are good for conservative, new investors. But the ARI (average rundom investiment) of the mutual funds are lower than the stock market. For the young advanced investors, they may be more interested in stock market, even with a higher risks and costs. 



MDSM is an ecolgy oriented math. To be used in financial sciences, it has to facing and past the toughest tests, then, to be considered to circulate in society. MDSM is not just to help people to mak profit, it is a system monitoring tool, to discover the systems successional trends. In the stock market, it has to beat the ARI, to prove its own value, but not only making profit. In another words,  we should not satisfied on making profit. The last year’ test, based on my knowledge, untill October, we are still behind the ARI. Even worse,  we could not trust the results, as the ARI is screwed up. We have to renew and update the old worksheet.



I will design a new worksheet using my own time and resource. This new worksheet will be using30 “relatively good” stocks as the dimensions, and the new worksheet will be links free, and protected by copywright. No body can change it without my written permission. So all the investment clubs will be using the same worksheet,  facing the same screen. This will help us exchange experiences, share information, and help each others, learn from each others, and compete to each others, and further develop the MDSM research and applications.
