Hi, GB and others,




I am in Tucson AZ.

I am working on designing a new worksheet for the new year of 2018.

This worksheet will include 30 variables, as well.

The thirty variables will be stocks, instead of mutual funds, differ from last year, but not the ETFs.

I have been collecting inputs from you guys, and now is the time to put them together.

I use the DIA-30 as my starting point and add your inputs to them. 

The DIA-30 are professionally selected stocks to represent whold stock market.




The DIA-30 and your recommandations together formed a watching list of 50 stocks. I delete 20 of them to form a last version of 30-stocks watching list to form another 30 dimensional space for the coming year.





Then I will design a new worksheet for me and the new people with different backgrounds: financial, math, or computer. 

I will take some notes recording the precedure, but in Chinese. Then, GB may take  them go through the computer to translate into English. Let's wait and see how that works. 

Then we will edit it together some time later.




Thank you,

My phone number here is : 970-581-0253, my cell phone.


Sounds, WeChat is not working anymoer.
