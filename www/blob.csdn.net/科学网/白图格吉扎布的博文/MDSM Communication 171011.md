MDSM Communication 171011

About the ARI:

You COULD change the components/variables/funds, but you should NOT change them in middle of an experiment.

We have been working in 30 dimensional space. So, changing variables is changing the 30-space, then everything in the 30-space get screwed.

I will teach you how to change variables/components by the end of the experiment, end of the year,  when you have more experience and more confidence. 

For just making money, we don't need ARI, average rondom investment. For a regular presentation, we can use DIA and/or SPY as a references. 

About the worksheet:

We are starting a new round investment test for the new year. 

For the new year, we are going to have a new worksheet. People found their own investment club: MDSM(i), i=1,2,3…  For the new year, we are going to use ETF market, which would involve trading fee, so the the bigger capital the better, < 2500*10.  I could  design a new worksheet on one of your computers. You, Edie, supply the ETF watching list. Different MDSM clubs use the same watching list, and same worksheet duringthe first year, so we can exchange and share same information and learn from each others.  The ownership of the worksheet belongs to me. Everyone in the club can use it, but not change it, nor release to some one else, without my written permission.

My planning:

I will continue to present the PPT to different Math department, in different Universities, until we find a English speaker Math Prof. who wants to join me to publish this research. 

If Georganne fill confident, I would suggest that Georganne go make the presentation to the Business School of the CSU, with my and James Liu help. Georganne can use your new data to fill in the fourth part of Cases Applications. We, Georganne and me, can further discuss that. This presentation to Business School should be done before our next round investment test, using ETF market data and new worksheet.

Edie, Larry, and Jakie may work on new watching list, and starting download the data. The best is that we start with three months data, or at least one and half (1.5) months data. 

I will be inTucson AZ. during the holiday season, Thanksgiven-New Years Day. 

We will keep in touch.
