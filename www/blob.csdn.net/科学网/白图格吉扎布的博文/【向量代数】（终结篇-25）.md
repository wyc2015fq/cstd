So far, we have been logically reasoning the systems monitoring.

Before go any further, let me give a summary:

Our world is made of systems, a single variable has to be put in a multitde systems to make meaning. For example a stock, it looks like a random variable, jumping around,but after putting in market, the Importance Value would be a constant.

If a 17-fund market systems be expressed by a 17-vectors, the length of the 17-vectors expresses the sum of the systems, but the 17-directions of the vectors in 17-space expresses the composition of the17-systems. The composition is essential for a 17-systems. The scalar multiplication would not change the systems, only the multiplication of 17-vectors can change the systems.

Forexample, A=3-2-1 is different from B=1-2-3, but same as A10=30-20-10. As the two are co-liners. A market expressed by #, dollar, yin, looks different, but it is the same market.

Vectoris also a multiplication Group. We can do very basic arithmetic. 

So far, 

IT IS SIMPLE, IS NOT IT?

IT IS EASY, IS NOT IT? 

Now we are going to some cases of applications, that is my favor, I will tell you, it is not only simple and easy, it is also powerful.  It can solve many problems that scalar, matrices, statistics could not do before.




to be continued
