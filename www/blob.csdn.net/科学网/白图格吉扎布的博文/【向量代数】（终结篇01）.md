Title:Theodorus Spiral, Vector Algebra and System Monitoring
Speaker: T. Jay Bai, Ph.D. 970-495-9716, tjbmdsm@yahoo.com

Abstract: 

“Theodorus Spiral” can be expressed as a 17*17 diagonal matrix, and then further as a 17-vector. Vectors are variables with both Magnitude and Directions. They are extension of scalars upon which the Group of multiplication apply. So they can be used for system monitoring. Vector length expresses the sum of the components, while the 17-directions carry the composition information of the systems. Rotations of the vectors in 17-space are considered as system successional trends, and are expressed by ratio of present and previous cosine values. Our trend analysis model has been tested in financial system by investment management and checked by the government. Furthermore, a time chain(Bai-Jameson Chain) based on trends has been developed for system prediction and monitoring.

Essential phrases: 

The Vector(𝑖), 𝑖=1,2,…𝑚， are the extension of scalars, 

and the scalars are the special cases of  𝑉𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠(𝑖) , 𝑖=1.

The 17-direction of 17-vector in 17-space expresses the composition of the 17-systems, and the composition is essential for systems.
