My name is Tugjayzhab Jay Bai. I am a quantitative Ecologist, and specialize in ecosystem-monitoring. To discover the degradation trends of grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China, 1984, I have started using inverse of a diagonal matrices to express the trends and using hyper cosine value as correlation coefficient to classify grasslands. Based on collected information and data, I predicted that the increasing trends of grassland degradation, and even dust storm increasing trend around Beijing, 1984. However, people did not like the information to be released, it was classified as “SECRET”. 

But I believe the trend is a true reality, and the research is important. As our world is made of systems, instead of variables, it is important that we can monitor our natural systems. I continue working on Multivariate data analysis methods for a proposed Grassland Monitoring Net. When I was working for LCTA, CSU, I have developed a system monitoring model, so called Multi-Dimensional SphereModel （MDSM）”, now I think it should be called VECTOR ALGEBRA, compare with the scalar Algebra and mat algebra （Linear Algebra). 

You all have learned y=f(x), expressing the relation among the variables. In this presentation, I will introduce you a simple, easy, yet powerful way to discover the relation among the systems:

𝑖=1,y=f(x) ⇒ 𝑌（𝑖)=𝑓(𝑋）（𝑖),𝑖=1,2,3,…17

And I expecting you telling me: this method is mathematically sound, and my English is understandable.
