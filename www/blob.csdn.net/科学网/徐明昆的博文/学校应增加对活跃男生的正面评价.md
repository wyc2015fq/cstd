中国中小学的导向，普遍要求学生循规蹈矩，不要乱说乱动。

大学生也普遍动手能力不足，中国出去的留学生也有这些弱点。

考试主要是机械重复性知识。


体育项目也被极大的限制，跳箱跳马器械课程现在都取消了。

精力旺盛，思想新奇，勇敢顽强，调皮捣乱的学生，被认为是“坏学生“。


扼杀了他们天生的好奇心和创造力，压抑了他们情商和冒险精神。





**这个教育制度，对男孩的损害尤其严重**，男孩今后是要闯天下的。

做父母的，如果看到你的孩子，特别是男孩子，安静乖顺，

不能敢想敢说敢动，你一定非常难过。



看看小老虎，小狮子，小猫，小鹿，那些活泼好动的，能打能闹的小动物，

不仅赢得人类的喜爱，也赢得他们同类的喜爱，事实上他们更强壮更健康，

生存繁殖的几率更高。小孩的天性何尝不如此。



在日本，柔道在学校的普及就像乒乓球在中国。完全不像人们印象中会增加打架，

而是学习宁静稳重的处事方式，和对对手的礼貌与尊重。

在美国，童子军是最大的民间组织，童子军晋升制度由人为设置的一系列障碍和步骤组成，

每个孩子都必须设法克服这些障碍。在登上月球的12名宇航员中，就有11名曾是是童子军成员。

美国前总统福特说：“我可以毫不犹豫地说，如果没有童子军精神，我不会成为一名好运动员，

不可能成为一名好的海军军官，也不可能成为一名好的议员，更不可能成为一名随时都能做好

一切准备的总统。”





如果充分发展儿童和学生们的天性，教育和考核会更复杂，运动防护更麻烦，

这需要更多的高素质的男老师，会增加老师的工作量。但这都是技术问题，不是根本困难。

教师和教育的责任，就是一切为了儿童和学生的全面成长。






中国学校的学生成绩单上，要有数理化音乐体育语文的成绩，还要有

发明创造的成绩，动手实际能力的成绩，军事训练的成绩。



本文宜于老师和为人父母者看。



[1]为什么女人更爱“坏男孩”http://edu.sina.com.cn/en/2012-04-23/094965955.shtml

It does make one wonder about why anyone with enough common sense would prefer to hang out with “bad boy” instead of someone with good credentials. Here are a few reasons why girls like bad boys: 
**Adventure**Good guys play it safe. Whether it is any physical activity or taking an important decision, they are always hesitant. Bad boys, on the other hand, are primarily known for the sense of adventure they carry on their sleeves. They are not scared of taking risks and give girls a sense of adventure that they want to experience. Women want to have a feeling of power that these guys readily provide。

**Living life**　Bad boys are seen as living life as it is meant to be lived. It is necessary here to define that bad boys do not mean criminals or anti-social elements but guys who lead happy lives by breaking norms rather than breaking laws (although the latter has its share of allure and fan following too). Bad boys, because of their propensity to leading the good life, are always clued in to the latest happenings and live with objects that good guys think twice before investing in. Mean bikes and jailbreaked Apple devices for example。

**Air of mystery**　There is something utterly predictable about a good guy once you've known him for a while. His tastes do not change simply because the year has. A bad guy, however, doesn't live by scruples. His main aim is to lead a happy life today. He is not bothered about his past nor worried about his future. The here and now and how that can be made better is all that matters to him. This lends an air of mystery to him and his actions because you can never predict what catches his fancy and how he will attain it from one day to the next。

**Good with girls**　It is a known fact that bad guys know how to score with girls. It is one of the reasons why they are tagged as bad guys in the first place! Such a group knows how to woo a woman and make her feel special. They can talk to her and when they feel like it, also talk back to her, giving the girls an opportunity to be aggressive as well. Good guys avoid conflict at all costs, leaving girls with no window to vent their frustration。

**It's biological****　　基因所然**　　Blame it on your forefathers, but the fact is that women are wired to seek out the most adventurous guy in any group. It goes back to survival of the fittest and other procreational jazz, but the short story is that, a woman will always prefer a man who is seen as taking initiative (with variable risk) over a steady guy waiting for something to happen to his life. Accept it: the only way of scoring with girls is to join this breed of bad boys and strike rich. Like it is said, if you can't beat them, join them。

　　　In spite of all these points, it doesn't mean that girls don't like good guys at all. There are women who love the company of good guys and would pick them over the 'bad boys' any given day。
