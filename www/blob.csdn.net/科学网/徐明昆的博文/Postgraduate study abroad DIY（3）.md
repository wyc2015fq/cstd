Following to the article :[Postgraduate study abroad DIY（2）](http://blog.sciencenet.cn/home.php?mod=space&uid=537101&do=blog&id=953820)

1.Thefactors that are stressed by US universities:[](http://www.baidu.com/link?url=26AJxxBHXT1xM9B5JWeHCzIsriLN3oG6qqXcy1HMPb3nSOG34BC2pzu7S0BJhawS1uI2l3NC1LpUtZSig7OAVkuKGFw2Ke9pYXkvKXWFYpXfOwEVnnjf5eWvuVyBY6Sy)

GPA ,GRE ,especially quantity section;

The reputation of your undergraduate university;

The quality of your paper published;

The intern  experience in transnational corporations;


Well known contest reward;

Leadership and social activity capability;

The capability that you or your family pay back to the university.




2.The geographic  factor  should fully consided by applicants:

East ,south,west area of US is suitable to live,

Five lakes area is a bit cold.

Most main computer corporations locate in western area，

Silicon Valley.





3.Economic condition impacts  admission notably:

It is estimated that the number of fellowship  offered to Chinese fresh postgraduate student is around 50 person  each year,the number of TA or RA  offered to Chinese is less than 500 ,if one applicant gets more one offer,only one is counted here)【1】.  Whereas more than  10000 chinese students go abroad to pursue post graduate education every year.

  So merely around  5%  post graduate students can received full funding

 support. 

Generally speaking, US or European  universities are eager in making money from Master students,especial Master of class who need not reseach.







4.What kind of academic degree is more helpful  to get admitted ,BS or MS?     

Only  a few famous universities  prefer to admit Chinese BS students , while most 

universities prefer to admit Chinese MS students ,except those applicants  who have 

work experience, for  famous universities do not worry about that students may 

transfer to other better universities.



 However,provided   that applicants prepareto enroll without funding, then  can easily  find  some universitis  such as USC  which issue tremendous number of Master degrees ,it does not  matter if applicants already have  Master degree.

中国科大2016的fully  funding人数，因为有些人拿了多个offer,只能算一个有效。这样看科大本硕合计(仅本科？）仅百人左右拿到全奖。清北复交大概总数差不多，工科比例大些。其它985，211全奖就少多了。
