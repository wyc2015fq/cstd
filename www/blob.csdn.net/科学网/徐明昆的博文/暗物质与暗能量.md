本文是“为什么物体的速度不能超过光速（之五）？ [http://bbs.sciencenet.cn/home.php?mod=space&uid=537101&do=blog&id=438868](http://bbs.sciencenet.cn/home.php?mod=space&uid=537101&do=blog&id=438868)“的扩展,继续谈鬼魅世界 




1937年，Fritz Zwicky发现大星系团中的星系据具有极高的运动速度，要束缚这些星系，星系团的质量应该是观测到的恒星总质量的100倍，即有大量暗物质存在。之后几十年的观测分析证实了这一点。80%的暗物质不成团二是均匀分布在宇宙中。正是暗物质促成了宇宙的形成。促成了星系，恒星和人类的诞生。

1998年，S.波尔穆特和B.史密特精确测量距离-红移关系，发现宇宙在加速膨胀，暗能量占主导的宇宙模型成为了一个和谐的宇宙模型。最近威尔金森宇宙微波背景辐射各向异性探测器（Wilkinson Microwave Anisotrope Probe，WMAP）的观测也独立的证实了暗能量的存在，并且使它成为了标准模型的一部分。 
S.波尔穆特和B.史密特因此获得2006年诺贝尔物理奖。

暗物质的存在理论被广泛认同。但科学家们也不知道究竟何为暗物质，由于暗物质既不释放任何光线，也不反射任何光线，因此最强大的天文望远镜都无法直接探测到它。 



地球上另一项探寻暗物质的尝试聚焦于强大的粒子加速器，这类加速器可以将亚原子粒子加速到接近光速，然后让它们相互碰撞。科学家们希望通过这种难以置信的高速碰撞从而产生奇异粒子，其中包括暗物质粒子（中微子，光微子，引力微子，超中微子，XX微子。。。）。然而，即使采用最强大的粒子加速器，至今也未能发现暗物质的任何迹象




Dark Matter（暗物质包括暗能量)被认为是宇宙研究中最具挑战性的课题，它代表了宇宙中90%(暗物质加暗能量90%）以上的物质含量，而我们可以看到的物质只占宇宙总物质量的10%不到(约5％左右)。1957年[诺贝尔奖](http://baike.baidu.com/view/6170.htm)的获得者[李政道](http://baike.baidu.com/view/33434.htm)更是认为其占了宇宙质量的99%。暗物质无法直接观测得到，但它却能干扰[星体](http://baike.baidu.com/view/407865.htm)发出的光波或[引力](http://baike.baidu.com/view/148429.htm)，其存在能被明显地感受到。科学家曾对暗物质的特性提出了多种假设，但直到目前还没有得到充分的证明。 

黑洞被认为是一种暗物质。但是推论有更大质量的暗物质。

暗能量和暗物质的唯一共同点是它们既不发光也不吸收光。从微观上讲，它们的组成是完全不同的。更重要的是，像普通的物质一样，暗物质是引力自吸引的，而且与普通物质成团并形成星系。而暗能量是引力自相斥的，并且在宇宙中几乎均匀的分布。所以，在统计星系的能量时会遗漏暗能量。因此，暗能量可以解释观测到的物质密度和由暴涨理论预言的临界密度之间70-80%的差异。

暗能量和普通物质和暗物质都不同，它产生负的压强。



暗物质和暗能量这两种假想概念，支撑着人们在２１世纪建立起来的众多理论——粒子模型、宇宙膨胀、宇宙辐射等。“了解暗物质和暗能量，是２１世纪科学史的大挑战。”２００８年１０月１２日，诺贝尔物理学奖获得者李政道教授在人民大会堂举行的“隆重纪念望远镜发明４００周年——科学大师演讲会”上这样说。这两种假想被证实或是被否定，都将对物理学的未来产生深远影响。 

到目前为止，“黑暗双塔”只统治着物质尺度的两极——动辄数亿光年的星系尺度以及小至百万分之一纳米（１纳米为十亿分之一米）的亚原子尺度。但这只是暂时的，我们在日常生活中不考虑这两种物质的存在，不仅是因为它们只在两极尺度产生显著的影响，还因为我们不了解它们。





**但是暗物质是否存在，也有强烈的反对声音：**

吴中祥老师认为不存在黑洞外的暗物质，他认为通过红移观测星系移动速度不合理，因为在同一个惯性系可用红移

理论， 在高速运动的非惯性系不可通过红移观测星系移动速度，所以暗物质也是子虚乌有。[http://bbs.sciencenet.cn/home.php?mod=space&uid=226&do=blog&id=440654](http://bbs.sciencenet.cn/home.php?mod=space&uid=226&do=blog&id=440654)。

中国人周坚于2008年6月29日在撰写完成的《精确膨胀宇宙学》中提出周坚红移定律，尝试完善牛顿万有引力定律。解释在宇宙学尺度上的运动原理不需要“暗能量”和“暗物质”来帮忙。

以色列物理学家Milgrom提出一套摆脱暗物质的理论MOND理论：在极大距离下，牛顿第二定律要修改。MOND就是Modified Newtonnian Dynamics，可以作为广义相对论的补充.MOND理论目前也不是符合所有观测结果，尚不清楚是观测有误还是该理论有误。而且它不能解决宇宙起源问题。



下面是NASA SCIENCE对暗物质暗能量的介绍：
Dark Energy, Dark Matter 

In the early 1990's, one thing was fairly certain about the expansion of the Universe. It might have enough energy density to stop its expansion and recollapse, it might have so little energy density that it would never stop expanding, but gravity was certain to slow the expansion as time went on. Granted, the slowing had not been observed, but, theoretically, the Universe had to slow. The Universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together. Then came 1998 and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of very distant supernovae that showed that, a long time ago, the Universe was actually expanding more slowly than it is today. So the expansion of the Universe has not been slowing due to gravity, as everyone thought, it has been accelerating. No one expected this, no one knew how to explain it. But something was causing it. 

Eventually theorists came up with three sorts of explanations. Maybe it was a result of a long-discarded version of Einstein's theory of gravity, one that contained what was called a "cosmological constant." Maybe there was some strange kind of energy-fluid that filled space. Maybe there is something wrong with Einstein's theory of gravity and a new theory could include some kind of field that creates this cosmic acceleration. Theorists still don't know what the correct explanation is, but they have given the solution a name. It is called dark energy. 
What Is Dark Energy? 

More is unknown than is known. We know how much dark energy there is because we know how it affects the Universe's expansion. Other than that, it is a complete mystery. But it is an important mystery. It turns out that [roughly 70%](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/news/5yr_release.html) of the Universe is dark energy. Dark matter makes up about 25%. The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the Universe. Come to think of it, maybe it shouldn't be called "normal" matter at all, since it is such a small fraction of the Universe.

This diagram shows changes in the rate of expansion since the Universe's birth 14 billion years ago. The more shallow the curve, the faster the rate of expansion. The curve changes noticeably about 7.5 billion years ago, when objects in the Universe began flying apart at a faster rate. Astronomers theorize that the faster expansion rate is due to a mysterious, dark energy that is pulling galaxies apart. Credit: NASA/STSci/Ann Feild 
One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space. Albert Einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing. Space has amazing properties, many of which are just beginning to be understood. The first property that Einstein discovered is that it is possible for more space to come into existence. Then one version of Einstein's gravity theory, the version that contains a [cosmological constant](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/08/), makes a second prediction: "empty space" can possess its own energy. Because this energy is a property of space itself, it would not be diluted as space expands. As more space comes into existence, more of this energy-of-space would appear. As a result, this form of energy would cause the Universe to expand faster and faster. Unfortunately, no one understands why the cosmological constant should even be there, much less why it would have exactly the right value to cause the observed acceleration of the Universe. Another explanation for how space acquires energy comes from the quantum theory of matter. In this theory, "empty space" is actually full of temporary ("virtual") particles that continually form and then disappear. But when physicists tried to calculate how much energy this would give empty space, the answer came out wrong - wrong by a lot. The number came out 10120 times too big. That's a 1 with 120 zeros after it. It's hard to get an answer that bad. So the mystery continues. 

> ![Perseus Cluster Dwarf Galaxies](http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2010/03/31/hs-perseus_cluster.jpg)
**[Perseus Cluster Dwarf Galaxies](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/11/full/) -** These four dwarf galaxies are part of a census of small galaxies in the tumultuous heart of the nearby Perseus galaxy cluster. The galaxies appear smooth and symmetrical, suggesting that they have not been tidally disrupted by the pull of gravity in the dense cluster environment. Larger galaxies around them, however, are being ripped apart by the gravitational tug of other galaxies. 
Another explanation for dark energy is that it is a new kind of dynamical energy fluid or field, something that fills all of space but something whose effect on the expansion of the Universe is the opposite of that of matter and normal energy. Some theorists have named this "quintessence," after the fifth element of the Greek philosophers. But, if quintessence is the answer, we still don't know what it is like, what it interacts with, or why it exists. So the mystery continues. 

A last possibility is that Einstein's theory of gravity is not correct. That would not only affect the expansion of the Universe, but it would also affect the way that normal matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies behaved. This fact would provide a way to decide if the solution to the dark energy problem is a new gravity theory or not: we could observe how galaxies come together in clusters. But if it does turn out that a new theory of gravity is needed, what kind of theory would it be? How could it correctly describe the motion of the bodies in the Solar System, as Einstein's theory is known to do, and still give us the different prediction for the Universe that we need? There are candidate theories, but none are compelling. So the mystery continues. 

The thing that is needed to decide between dark energy possibilities - a property of space, a new dynamic fluid, or a new theory of gravity - is more data, better data. The [Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM)](http://science.nasa.gov/missions/jdem) is a NASA mission which is currently under study. Its goal will be to provide observations of the Universe that will allow theorists to discriminate between theories and, perhaps, finally lead to the solution of the mystery. 

> ![New Clue to Dark Matter](http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2010/03/31/hs-2008-32-a-small_web.jpg)[A Clash of Clusters Provides New Clue to Dark Matter](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/2008/32/results/100/) A powerful collision of galaxy clusters has been captured by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory. The observations of the cluster known as MACS J0025.4-1222 indicate that a titanic collision has separated the dark from ordinary matter and provide an independent confirmation of a similar effect detected previously in a target dubbed the Bullet Cluster. These new results show that the Bullet Cluster is not an anomalous case. What Is Dark Matter? 

By fitting a theoretical model of the composition of the Universe to the combined set of cosmological observations, scientists have come up with the composition that we described above, ~70% dark energy, ~25% dark matter, ~5% normal matter. What is dark matter? 

We are much more certain what dark matter is not than we are what it is. First, it is dark, meaning that it is not in the form of stars and planets that we see. Observations show that there is far too little visible matter in the Universe to make up the 25% required by the observations. Second, it is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter, matter made up of particles called baryons. We know this because we would be able to detect baryonic clouds by their absorption of radiation passing through them. Third, dark matter is not antimatter, because we do not see the unique gamma rays that are produced when antimatter annihilates with matter. Finally, we can rule out large galaxy-sized black holes on the basis of how many gravitational lenses we see. High concentrations of matter bend light passing near them from objects further away, but we do not see enough lensing events to suggest that such objects to make up the required 25% dark matter contribution. 

However, at this point, there are still a few dark matter possibilities that are viable. Baryonic matter could still make up the dark matter if it were all tied up in brown dwarfs or in small, dense chunks of heavy elements. These possibilities are known as massive compact halo objects, or "[MACHOs](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/teachers/galaxies/imagine/dark_matter.html)". But the most common view is that dark matter is not baryonic at all, but that it is made up of other, more exotic particles like axions or [WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/teachers/galaxies/imagine/dark_matter.html).
