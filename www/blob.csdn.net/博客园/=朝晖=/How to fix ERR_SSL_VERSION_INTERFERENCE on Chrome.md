ERR_SSL_VERSION_INTERFERENCE is quite an old error that users get on Google Chrome browser. However, some also reported the same issue happening on Mozilla Firefox.[[1]](https://ugetfix.com/ask/how-to-fix-err_ssl_version_interference-on-chrome/#ref-1) The error is closely related to The ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH and ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR, as all of these issues occur due to the misconfiguration of SSL certificate.
The ERR_SSL_VERSION_INTERFERENCE error might be occurring due to these issues:
- Problems with third-party anti-virus software;
- Incorrect Time and Date settings on your computer;
- Hardware acceleration[[2]](https://ugetfix.com/ask/how-to-fix-err_ssl_version_interference-on-chrome/#ref-2) being on;
- Incorrect time and date settings on the computer;
- Outdated Google Chrome or antivirus versions;
- Cookies and browsing data.
While these problems among those which users said fixed ERR_SSL_VERSION_INTERFERENCE error, the solution that worked for most was disabling of the Google's TLS (Transportation Layer Security) 1.3 protocol[[3]](https://ugetfix.com/ask/how-to-fix-err_ssl_version_interference-on-chrome/#ref-3) which provides privacy and performance improvements in comparison to previous versions.
![ERR_SSL_VERSION_INTERFERENCE error fix](https://ugetfix.com/wp-content/uploads/articles/askit/err-ssl-version-interference-error-fix_en.jpg)
Therefore, multiple users argued if it is a solution at all, as disabling the feature does reduce online security. However, this might be a workaround to fix ERR_SSL_VERSION_INTERFERENCE error, if no other options help. We will provide the instructions on how to disable TLS 1.3 as the last solution but beware that it might decrease your online safety.
Other solution would be to disable for scanning of HTTPS in anti-virus software, as some of AVs use a man in the middle scanners that may not support the same TLS 1.3 version. 
## Solution 1. Remove or reinstall anti-malware software
