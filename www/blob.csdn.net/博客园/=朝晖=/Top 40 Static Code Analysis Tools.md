*In this article, I have summarised some of the top static code analysis tools.*
Can we ever imagine sitting back and manually reading each line of codes to find flaws? To ease our work, several types of static analysis tools are available in the market which helps to analyze the code during the development and detect fatal defects early in the SDLC phase.
Such defects can be eliminated before the code is actually pushed for functional QA. A defect found later are always expensive to fix.
Read this to get an idea of what can help you the most based on your needs –
