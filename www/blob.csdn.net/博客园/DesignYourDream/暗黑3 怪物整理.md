## Monsters
Diablo 3 offers countless monsters for you to decimate. The toughest of these monsters are buffed with a variety of affixes. These affixes add special abilities, powers, and other buffs to the monsters in addition to their normal attacks. Understanding monster affixes is critical to gameplay at higher difficulty levels as a tough set of affixes will mean certain death without a proper strategy.
This guide offers information on all monster affixes in Diablo 3 as well as tips for defeating monsters with the affix.
## Types of Monsters
 Normal 
Normal monster names appear in white text. These are your ‘trash mobs’ in lower difficulty levels and are almost no threat to you. However, at higher difficulty levels packs of normal monsters can be deadly. Normal monsters will never have affixes.
 Champions 
Champion monsters normally appear in groups of 3-4 with a blue glow. Their names also appear in blue. Champions can be quite deadly and may have multiple affixes. It is often best to focus on one champion quickly to reduce their numbers and balance the fight in your favor.
 Rares 
Rare monsters are easy to spot as they are quite large and have a yellow glow. These monsters also appear with a pack of minions. Both the rare monster and its minions will have affixes.
##  Affixes 
There are 25 affixes in Diablo 3. Affixes are assigned randomly each time you enter the game. You can “reset” affixes by leaving and re-entering your game to try and get easier combinations. The number of affixes on monsters increases with the difficulty level with Normal mode monsters carrying 1 affix and Inferno monsters carrying 4 affixes.
