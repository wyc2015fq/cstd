We currently provide densely sampled **SIFT**[1] features. We provide raw SIFT descriptors as well as quantized codewords. Spatial coordiates of each descriptor/codeword are also included. The quantized codewords are suitable for **Bag of Words** representations[2][3]. The features are packaged as Matlab files and can be freely downloaded ( no signing-in is required ). Details are as follows:
Each image is resized to have a max side length of no more than 300 pixel. SIFT descriptors are computed on 20x20 overlapping patches with a spacing of 10 pixels. Images are further downsized (to 1/2 the side length and then 1/4 of the side length) and more descriptors are computed. We use the [VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/)[4] implemenation of dense SIFT (version 0.9.4.1).![](http://www.image-net.org/feature_fig/dog_intdet.png)We perform k-means clustering of a random subset of 10 million SIFT descriptors to form a visual vocabulary of 1000 visual words. Each SIFT descriptor is quantized into a visual word using the nearest cluster center.![](http://www.image-net.org/feature_fig/dog_quantized.png)References:- David G.

###### How to download?
- We have not yet released SIFT features for all synsets. To check the list of synsets with SIFT features released, please use the API:- http://www.image-net.org/api/text/imagenet.sbow.obtain_synset_list
You can [click here](http://www.image-net.org/api/text/imagenet.sbow.obtain_synset_wordlist) to obtain the synset names.
- When you browse ImageNet from the Explore page, you can download the bag of visual words (sbow) feature of a synset if there is an icon "Download BoW Feature" below the image view panel.
You can download the bag of visual words ( sbow ) feature for a given synset using the API:- http://www.image-net.org/api/download/imagenet.sbow.synset?wnid=[wnid]
The API will return a Matlab ( .mat ) file. In the Matlab file, each descriptor has 5 fields: *x, y, norm, scale, word*. The *word* field is the index of the cluster center, i.e. an integer between 0 and 999.
###### Code for computing the features
- The code used to computing the features has been released in the [development kit](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2010/download/ILSVRC2010_devkit-1.0.tar.gz) of the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC2010)](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2010/index). Please consult the readme file in the kit for details.
To learn more about downloading using the HTTP protocol, please refer to *[API documentation](http://www.image-net.org/download-API)*.
