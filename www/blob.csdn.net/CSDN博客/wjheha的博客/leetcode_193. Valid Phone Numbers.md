Given a text file file.txt that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.
You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)
You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.
For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:
987-123-4567 
123 456 7890 
(123) 456-7890 
Your script should output the following valid phone numbers: 
987-123-4567 
(123) 456-7890
提示：提交代码后，需要用简洁的语言解释一下代码思路~ 谢谢
