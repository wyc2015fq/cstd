Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Note: 
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation. 
Example 1: 
Input: 5 
Output: 2 
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2. 
Example 2: 
Input: 1 
Output: 0 
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
提示：提交代码后，需要用简洁的语言解释一下代码思路~ 谢谢
