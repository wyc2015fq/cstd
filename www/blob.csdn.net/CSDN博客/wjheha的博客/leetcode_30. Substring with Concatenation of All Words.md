You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
For example, given: 
s: “barfoothefoobarman” 
words: [“foo”, “bar”]
You should return the indices: [0,9]. 
(order does not matter).
提示：提交代码后，需要用简洁的语言解释一下代码思路~ 谢谢
