Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.
Example 1: 
Input: [1,3,5,4,7] 
Output: 2 
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7]. 
Example 2: 
Input: [2,2,2,2,2] 
Output: 5 
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences’ length is 1, so output 5. 
Note: Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
提示：提交代码后，需要用简洁的语言解释一下代码思路~ 谢谢
