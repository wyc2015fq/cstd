Given a binary tree where every node has a unique value, and a target key k, find the value of the closest leaf node to target k in the tree.
Here, closest to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.
In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row. The actual root tree given will be a TreeNode object.
提示：提交代码后，需要用简洁的语言解释一下代码思路~ 谢谢
