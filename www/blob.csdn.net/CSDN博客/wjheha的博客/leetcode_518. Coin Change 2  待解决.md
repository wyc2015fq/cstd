You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.
Note: You can assume that
0 <= amount <= 5000 
1 <= coin <= 5000 
the number of coins is less than 500 
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer 
Example 1:
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount: 
5=5 
5=2+2+1 
5=2+1+1+1 
5=1+1+1+1+1
提示：提交代码后，需要用简洁的语言解释一下代码思路~ 谢谢
