# Open Source videoSIP softphone for Windows [http://www.officesip.com/messenger.html](http://www.officesip.com/messenger.html)
Most offices are using a single Internet uplink to connect with the world. Sharing a single Internet connection means that a NAT router is often in place. Combined with a firewall, the router can prevent many voice communicators from streaming audio and video.
 OfficeSIP Messenger implements ICE, STUN, and TURN protocols to easily traverse NAT and firewalls with no additional configuration required on either side. TLS support ensures that all communications are securely encrypted, and cannot be intercepted by a third
 party.
**Supporting text, voice and video chats, the free softphone implements ICE, STUN, and TURN protocols to easily traverse NAT and firewalls, and supports TLS for ultimate communication security.**
