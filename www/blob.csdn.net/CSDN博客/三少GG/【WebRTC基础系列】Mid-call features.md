1.[什么是Mid-call?](http://www.freshpatents.com.sixxs.org/Mid-call-features-dt20080320ptan20080070528.php)
BACKGROUND 
This invention relates to mid-call features in a telephone communication system. 
Many telephone systems provide users with
**mid-call features that may be invoked while a call is in progress.** For example, in a telephone system using a convention Private Branch Exchange (PBX), a user may press a "hook flash" button on their telephone
 set (terminal) that is detected by the PBX. Examples of a mid-call feature include establishment of a three-way call, call transfer, and answering or other disposition(处理，处置) of an second incoming call. 
CDMA and GSM cellular telephone systems also provide some mid-call features. For example, in some systems a second inbound
 call may be answered by a user, by pressing the "Call" button on a mobile telephone and the subscriber can toggle between the two calls with the cellular telephone system switching the call that is sent to the user's telephone. Similarly, in some systems,
 a user may establish a multiple-party conference during an existing call by dialing and pressing the "call" button. 
Some telephony systems also provide access to mid-call
 features by monitoring the audio signal passing from a telephone to detect signaling tones(拨号音) (i.e., dual-tone multiple frequency, DTMF).
