create custom [UIControl](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIControl_Class/index.html) or
 custom [UIView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIView_Class/index.html) objects
 that can be reused.
In the following steps I will visually show and explain
 what you'll need to do to create an [IBDesignable
 and IBInspectable](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-IB_objects_media/chapters/CreatingaLiveViewofaCustomObject.html) UIView that you can reuse in your iPhone apps. You will be able to leverage the power of design time editing in Xcode along with a better
 visualization of what your app will look like.
