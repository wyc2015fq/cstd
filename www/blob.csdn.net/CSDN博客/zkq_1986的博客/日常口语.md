打扰下，您通过支付宝定的pizza，我们没有，我们现在给您换成了奶茶。这里面存在差价，我们需要把多出的钱还给您。而我们无法直接通过支付宝还给您，所以只能用现金形式直接给您。您觉得可行吗？

### 3 欢迎来到中国

欢迎来到中国。在中国，有四个地方最具代表性，推荐你去看看。第一个是北京，它是中国的政治中心。第二个是上海，它是中国的经济中心。这两个城市都可称得上是国际化大都市。第三个是西安，它是中国最古老的城市，那里有著名的兵马俑。第四个是桂林，它是中国最美的地方，中国有句古话，“桂林山水甲天下！”，说的就是桂林的山水景色天下第一。

Fourth is Guilin, which is Chinese most beautiful place. In China there are old saying that Guilin’s scenery is the best in the world.

### 4 大数据

大数据是一种用传统硬件和软件无法直接解决的新兴科技领域。当前的互联网公司，拥有大数据，它们所做的工作与大数据紧密相关。而部分未拥有大数据的公司，虽然从事大数据工作，但它们仅是利用传统方法在大数据平台上跑下小量数据，跟真正的大数据还有很大差距。

Big data is a new science and technology field that can’t be settled with traditional hardware and software. At present, Internet companies have big data. Their works have tightly relation with big data. But some other haven’t big data companies have large gap with real big data. Although they work with big data , but they only run small scale data with traditional method on big data platform.

### 7 寻找酒店

您好！是五星级大酒店吗？我是来自中国的Zuao先生，我前天预定了您的酒店房间，我大概会住上一个星期，我过来是给印尼银行做大数据平台系统的技术支持。我现在已到印度尼西亚。一下飞机我就直奔贵酒店。但是我现在迷路了，找不到贵酒店在哪。我目前的位置是在中央路，我可以看到电信大楼。请问我现在应该怎么走才能到贵酒店呀？

Hello! Is that Five Start Hotel? I’m Mr. Zuao from China. I ordered a room the day before yesterday, and I’ll stop at your hotel for about one week.

I can’t find where your hotel is. My current position is in Center Load. I can see Telecom building. Please help me to find a way to go to your hotel.

### 8 大数据时代

当前，已从IT时代渐渐转入DT时代。数据科学家称为所有职业中最赚钱的职业之一。大数据是一种挑战也是一种机遇。当今各大传统IT厂商和新兴互联网公司都加入大数据的晚宴中。大数据概念提出已有好几年。现在各大公司都推出根据自身需求定制的大数据产品。

Today, it has already changed from IT generation to DT generation. Data Scientist has become the most money earning career among all careers. Big data is a challenge, but is a chance too. Now a lot of traditional IT producer and emerging Internet company are entering big data party. The concept of big data has been proposed many years ago. A lot of corporations produce big data product according their own demands, not only limit to concept hype.

### 9 2016美国总统竞选

代表共和党的Donald Trump和代表民主党的Hillary Clinton在2016年展开总统竞选。选票工作即将结束，竞选结果也将于12月份公布。谁将是美国的下一任总统，带领美国走向更加辉煌的未来，给世界带领更加和平稳定的发展契机，让我们拭目以待。

Donald Trump on behalf of Republican Party and Hillary Clinton on behalf of Democracy Party are debating on presidential position on 2016. The voting works are ending, and the result will be showed by the end of December. Who will be the next generation president that brings America to the more brilliant future and takes the world more peace and stable development opportunity.  Let’s wait and see.

### 10 叙利亚战争

受俄罗斯支持的政府军和受美国支持的反对派，依然在部分地区激战。虽然关心叙利亚战局的几个国家目前在Swiss召开高层talks讨论停战协定（truce deal），但是要走的道路甚远。

Government Army supported by Russia and Rebel Army supported by America are still in bloody battle. Although high-level talks was hold by caring for Syria situation countries such as Russia, America, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, British, France and Germany Recently to come up with truce deal, but there still is a long way to go.

### 11 无人驾驶汽车

无人驾驶汽车将会在未来成为最畅销的汽车，虽然估计还要等20-30年。目前很多IT企业加入研发行列。比如，百度与国内汽车厂商合作，开发无人驾驶汽车；谷歌则与通用汽车合作研发高性能无人驾驶汽车；近期，有消息称苹果将自研无人驾驶汽车，延续其一贯的独立、完美、整体不可分割的作风。之所以说无人驾驶汽车还要等个几十年，是因为驾驶的精度完全靠传感器来支撑。目前这类型的传感器十分昂贵。要想让汽车成为一般大众能消费的起的产品，还需在传感器的成本上加以突破。

Pilotless automobile will be the most marketable among the automobile field in future, although it will be waited 20-30 years long. Recently, many IT corporations enter into pilotless automobile developing. For example, Baidu cooperated with Chinese automobile producer develops a pilotless auto. Google cooperated with American GE launches high performance pilotless car, depending on their powerful artifact intelligence technology. In present, it is said that Apple will produce pilotless car by itself, continuing their independent, perfect, and indivisibly integrative style. Why say pilotless automobile need be waited for some decades? Because drive precision is definitely decided by sensors. These sensors are very costly recently. If we want let pilotless car become a product massive has ability to buy, we need to do recreation on sensor’s cost.

### 12 美国总统竞选2

从目前的民意测验上看，希拉里明显领先Trump。希拉里作为曾经的第一夫人以及现在的国务卿，在美国具有广泛的知名度，有大量的钱、媒体渠道的支持。相比之下，Trump就要穷多了。据说在今年5月份，Trump团队还被爆出闹钱慌。这周希拉里和Trump会有最后一次的debate，这次debate具有决定性的作用。如果话题讨论的是希腊里的record，那么Trump很容易获胜；如果话题讨论的是Trump的女性歧视，那么Trump将彻底失败。

Hillary Clinton is ahead before Donald Trump from current polls. Hillary Clinton’s group has much money and many media supported. Hillary Clinton was a first lay of America and is secretary of the country, who has extensive popularity. In contrast, Donald Trump is looked more poor. It was said that the group was lack of money in May. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be a last debate which is a decisive role on this weekend. If the conversation was talk about Hillary’s record, then Trump would be possibly success. In contrast, If the conversation was talk about Trump’s discriminate of women, then Trump would be certainly lose.

### 13 地铁破天荒出故障

今天地铁出现故障，临时停车好长时间，导致我坐到软件大道时候还要步行到公司。在步行中，我花了大概15分钟。幸好公司实行弹性制上班时间，可以弹到九点，所以没有迟到，否则就亏大了。哈哈。有惊无险呀。地铁出现故障的概率估计远小于汽车的概率，因此以后要是自驾上班，迟到的风险好大啊。

Today railway was encountered a trouble, stopping a long time, so that I must walk to company from RuanjianRoad Station. I spend about 15 minutes among the walk. Thanks to executing elastic work time, which can elastic to nine o’clock, that I am not late, otherwise, I would loss too much. HaHa. It’s more scared than hurt. It’s less probability of breakdown for railway than for car. So there would be much risk of drive by myself in future.

### 14 大麻的认同

有一项研究表明，美国人对大麻的支持率随着时间的变化发生较大波动。在1970s上升到28%，1980s由于禁止大麻原因有所下滑，到1990s降到24%，到世纪之交时候又上升到30%左右，而到2013年，支持率急剧上升到60%左右。研究人员试图解释这种波动现象的原因，但发现这是一个法律和人们赞同之间的一个dilemma。有些人会说部分地区的法律都支持了，那我觉得我们地区赞同大麻合法化也未尝不可。而通常来说，法律是由于大部分人的支持才会生效的。

One research expresses that the support of marijuana is fluctuation with time in America. It’s rose to 28 percent in the 1970s, slipped during “Just Say No” campaign of 1980s, stayed around 24 percent in the 1990s and rose to 30 percent at the turn of the century, but rose to 60 percent in 2013. Researchers try to explain the reason of fluctuation, but find it’s a dilemma between the legalization and people’s approval. Some men will say the legal is approval of marijuana in some district, then why I don’t agree it? But In general, legalization of certain thing is based on many people’s support.

### 15 美国射电望远镜

美国一个州的射电望远镜正在弹出1500光年的行星。这颗行星一直在闪烁，让人觉得奇怪，该研究机构的人员正加紧工作，希望能找到有用的信息并加以解释。

Scientists using a radio telescope, in West Virginia, America, try effort to explore mystery of ‘alien megastructure’ star 1,500 light-year far away. The star is always winking that was interested by scientists. The researcher was making hard work to find a useful information to explain why the star is winking.

### 16 我家排污泵坏了

昨天我家的地下室排污抽水泵上的出水软接管破了一个洞，导致污水处理系统瘫痪。我昨天去杂货店买了一个水绷带，我本来想用他来堵住那个洞，废了大半天功夫，绑好之后，实验了下，结果失败了。后来上天猫找卖家询问，卖家先是要了我的订单号，确认是否是在他家买的，后来就说这个产品是原装进口的，他那边也没有配件。我晕~大部分卖家都是卖你东西之前把你当上帝捧着，卖给你之后出问题了，就极力把自己脱得一干二净，把责任推给别人。

My house soft pipe for out water on pollution pump equipment at basement was broken a hole, which leads to the breakdown of pollution water process system. I bought a specific bandage at a grocery. I wanted to use the specific bandage to stop water spill out, but it was fail after hard few hours. Then I went to TianMao to consult with the pollution pump equipment seller. Firstly, The customer servicer ask for the order id to assure whether the product was bought from his store. Then he said the product was imported with original packaging which mean he has no relation fitting parts. Son of a bitch. Many sellers treat you as god before deal. But after the deal, if you find some problem of the product, they would try hard to make the responsibility off by transferring the responsibility to other people. 

### 17 程序员修炼

对于我来说，我应该在英语和大数据挖掘方面深入，其他事情都不用管。要认清自己的学习能力和记忆能力有限，不能考虑广度，仅需考虑深度。大数据挖掘方面主要需要学习Hbase/spark/kafka/storm/zookeeper/phoenix、常见机器学习算法和深度学习算法。英语方面注重口语能力的培养，当然阅读能力也不能忽略。就这些，把问题简单化，不要搞太多东西。

For me, I should learn deeply in English and big data mining, and shouldn’t tackle any other things. I should recognize my limitation on learning and memory ability. I can’t consider extent while consider deep. In big data mining field, I need to learn Hbase, spark, kafka, storm, zookeeper, phoenix, general machine learning algorithm and deep learning algorithm. In English field, I concern about speaking English, and shouldn’t ignore reading ability also. Just this things. Make things simply, not complex. I believe my future will be more glorious.

### 18 意大利一个中世纪小镇开始复苏

意大利一个中世纪小镇开始复苏。二十年前，这里还很破败。大部分的人都外出务工，留下少量农民和老弱病残。大概在1995年，一个摩托车自驾游的人来到这里，发现这里很有商机，买了好几栋房子改造成hotel，不久就吸引了好多游客。近年来，来这里的游客每年已从10年前的900人上升到5000人。

A medieval village in Italy is reviving. Twenty years ago, here was looked like abandoned. Most of people were gone to city to earn money, leaving few farmer and older, kids. About in 1995, a motorcycle trip man came here. He found there was a lot of business chance in here. So he bought some house to change to hotel. Not a long time, here attracted many visitors. It’s said that the village saw 5000 visitors in 2015 versus 900 in 2005.

### 19 俯首甘为孺子牛

昨天去牛首山玩了。南京有句古话，“春牛首，秋栖霞”，虽然是在秋天去牛首，但景色还是不错。在景区入口，映入眼帘的便是风铃塔。在塔上面有400个风铃并刻有“牛首胜景”四个大字。再看远处的半山上，有一座50米高的塔。山上还有一处景，称为“佛顶宫”，是供奉佛主头颅顶片的地方，让人膜拜。

I went to NiuShou Mountain to play yestarday. It’s said that spring NiuShou and fall QiXia. Although it’s in fall to NiuShou, the prospect still not bad. Once we enter the scene, we can see a wind-bell tower. The tower has 400 wind-bells and be carved four character which is Niu Shou Shen Jing. Then looking the middle of the mountain beyond, there is a tower which is 500 meters high. At the mountain, there is another prospect, called ‘Fo Ding Gong’, which placed a piece of skull of Sijiamoni, accepting peoples’ worship.

### 20 意识和精神关系

There is different between conscious and spirit. Conscious is a process that between the outer percept and inner absorb among thought, while spirit is a process that between inner thought and the outer presentation. Absolutely, conscious precedes spirit. People present spirit after having conscious.

### 1 不同人对古松的态度

不同人对松树的“知觉”结果是不同的。假如你是一位木商，你脱离不了木商的心习，你所知觉到的只是一棵做某事用值多少钱的木料。假如我是一位植物学家，我也脱离不了我的植物学家的心习，我所知觉到的只是一棵叶为针状、果为球状、四季常青的显花植物。假如我们的朋友是一位画家，他什么事都不管，只管审美，他所知觉到的只是一棵苍翠劲拔的松树。

Toward pine, the result of ‘perception’ is different. If you are a wood businessman, you can’t escape the heart habit of wood businessman. You only sense a lumber that worth how much money for doing something. If I’m a botanist, I can’t escape my heart habit too. I sense a phanerogam that leaf is acerose, fruit is sphere, and four quarter is always green. If our friend is a painter, he’ll only make aesthetic appreciation, ignoring others. He senses a pine that is verdant and strong and durable.
