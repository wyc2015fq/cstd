(1) A [computer
 system](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/computer_system.html) that is accessed by a [user](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/U/user.html) working
 at a[remote](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/R/remote.html) location.
 Typically, the term is used when there are two computer systems connected by [modems](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/modem.html) and
 telephone lines. The[system](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/system.html) that
 contains the [data](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/data.html) is
 called the host, while the [computer](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/computer.html)at
 which the user sits is called the remote [terminal](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/terminal.html).

(2) A computer that is connected to a TCP/IP network, including the[Internet](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/Internet.html).
 Each host has a unique [IP address](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html).


(3) To provide the infrastructure for a computer service. For example, there are many companies that host files, programs, applications or even a [Web
 server](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_server.html) for companies and individuals. In the case of a Web server, it means that they provide the[hardware](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/hardware.html), [software](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/software.html),
 and communications lines required by the server, but the content on the server may be controlled by someone else.
