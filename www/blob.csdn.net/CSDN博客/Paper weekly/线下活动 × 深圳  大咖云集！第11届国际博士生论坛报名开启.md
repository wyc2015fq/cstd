**  报告题目 **** Knowledge-rich Speech Processing: Beyond Current Deep Learning**




Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming ubiquitous in designing speech processing algorithms. However, the robustness issues that have hindered a wide-spread deployment of speech technologies for decades still have not been fully resolved. In this talk, we first discuss capabilities and limitations of deep learning technologies. Next, we illustrate three knowledge-rich techniques, namely: (1) automatic speech attribute transcription (ASAT) integrating acoustic phonetic knowledge into speech processing and computer assisted pronunciation training (CAPT), (2) Bayesian DNNs leveraging upon speaker information for adaptation and system combination, and (3) DNN-based speech pre-processing, demonstrating better acoustics leads to more accurate speech recognition. Finally, we argue that domain knowledge in speech, language and acoustics is heavily needed beyond current blackbox deep learning in order to formulate sustainable whitebox solutions to further advance speech technologies.

**** 报告题目 ****** Edge AI for Data-Intensive Internet of Things **




Internet of Things (IoT) represent a broad class of systems which interact with the physical world by tightly integrating sensing, communication, and compute with physical objects. Many IoT applications are data-intensive and mission-critical in nature, which generate significant amount of data that must be processed within stringent time constraints. It’s estimated that 0.75 GB of data can be produced by an autonomous vehicle each second. The existing Cloud computing paradigm is inadequate for such applications due to significant or unpredictable delay and concerns on data privacy. 




In this talk, I will present our recent work on Edge AI, which aims to address the challenges of data-intensive IoT by intelligently distributing compute, storage, control and networking along the continuum from Cloud to Things. First, I will present ORBIT, a system for programming Edge systems and partitioning compute tasks among network tiers to minimize the system power consumption while meeting application deadlines. ORBIT has been employed in several systems for seismic sensing, vision-based tracking, and multi-camera 3D reconstruction. Second, I will briefly describe several systems we developed for mobile health, smart cities, volcano and aquatic monitoring, which integrate domain-specific physical models with AI algorithms. We have conducted several large-scale field deployments for these systems, including installing a seismic sensor network at two live volcanoes in Ecuador and Chile.

**** 报告题目 ****** Mental Health Computing via Harvesting Social Media Data **




Psychological stress and depression are threatening people’s health. It is non-trivial to detect stress or depression timely for proactive care. With the popularity of social media, people are used to sharing their daily activities and interacting with friends on social media platforms, making it feasible to leverage online social media data for stress and depression detection. In this talk, we will systematically introduce our work on stress and depression detection employing large-scale benchmark datasets from real-world social media platforms, including 1) stress-related and depression-related textual, visual and social attributes from various aspects, 2) novel hybrid models for binary stress detection, stress event and subject detection, and cross-domain depression detection, and finally 3) several intriguing phenomena indicating the special online behaviors of stressed as well as depressed people. We would also like to demonstrate our developed mental health care applications at the end of this talk.

**** 报告题目 ****** Meeting the New Challenges in Speech Processing: Some NPU-ASLP Approaches **




Speech has become a popular human-machine interface due to fast development of deep learning, big data and super-computing. We can see many applications in smartphones, TVs, robots and smart speakers. However, for further wide deployments of speech interfaces, there are still many challenges we have to face, such as noise interferences, inter- and intra-speaker variations, speaking styles and low-resource scenarios. In this talk, I will introduce several approaches, recently developed in the Audio, Speech and Language Processing Group, Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU-ASLP) team, to meet these challenges in speech recognition, speech enhancement and speech synthesis.

**** 报告题目 ****** Event Level Video Captioning based on Attentional RNN **




Video understanding is a hotspot and challenge subject featured by jointly knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. More and more commercial application of online multimedia content requires better automatic understanding of video events. Unlike image captioning, video captioning faces more obstacles. First, video is complex data form to get and utilize feature, comparing to image. The temporal change makes sufficient information and different methods have their own shortages in mining temporal information. Second, in the task of captioning, the generation of sentence is required to extract dynamic information from videos. While some methods deal well with short ant monotone actions, mining with longer and more complex actions is next goal. Third, some new tasks like captioning multiple events, call for new algorithm to get event-level processing. When generating sentences, correctly generate words like “continue” or “another” is one manifestation of good exploit context information.

**** 报告题目 ****** Developing a Personalized Emotional Conversational Agent for Learning Spoken English **




The spoken English skill is critical but challenging for non-native learners in China due to lack of enough practice, while improving spoken English is in large demand among learners of different ages. This talk presents our ongoing project at SpeechX on developing a personalized emotional conversational agent which aims to provide a virtual partner for language learners to practice their spoken English. Such an agent is personalized based on each learner’s English level and interests, and meanwhile gives appropriate responses according to the learner’s emotions. Developing the agent involves a lot of research challenges such as consistency and personalization in dialog systems, multimodal emotion recognition, expressive speech synthesis and so on. In this talk, we will briefly introduce our work responding to these challenges, present a preliminary proof-of-concept prototype and discuss future research perspectives.
