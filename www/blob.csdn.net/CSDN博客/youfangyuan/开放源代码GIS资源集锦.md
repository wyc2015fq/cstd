This effort represents an attempt to build a complete index of Open Source / Free GIS related software projects. The effort has some way to go, especially for projects in languages other than English. The definition of GIS has
 been kept loose to encompass a broad range of projects which deal with spatial data.
If you know of other sites that should be listed please tell me about them. More importantly if I have made any errors in characterizing a project, let me know: bglewis<at>gmail.com.
This effort stands on the sturdy shoulders of other projects, most notably [OSRS](http://remotesensing.org/) , [FreeGIS.org](http://freegis.org/), [Metalab
 Linux Archive](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/), and [Fresh Meat.net](http://freshmeat.net/).
Descriptive text gathered from the project site is in quotes. Almost all of these projects fit the definition of Open Source Software as defined by the [Open
 Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/), and most of them fit the stricter definition of Free Software as defined by the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/).
After many great years working for ATS, Inc. (now [GeographIT](http://www.geographit.com/)), I have taken a position
 with [Harvard's Center for Geographic Analysis](http://gis.harvard.edu/).
For a list of interesting GIS related sites, check these [del.icio.us
 bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/benlewis/gis). Not familiar with [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/)?
