## **Introduction**

Cell reselection is a complex process in LTE. The following extract from [1] provides a very good understanding of the overall procedure.
## **LTE Initial Access**
![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1289774169230/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Line.bmp)
Like all mobile communication systems, in LTE a terminal must perform certain steps 
before it can receive or transmit data. These steps can be categorized in cell search 
and cell selection, derivation of system information, and random access. The complete 
procedure is known as LTE Initial Access and is shown in the Figure below. After the initial 
access procedure, the terminal is able to receive and transmit its user data.

Initial synchronization

Successful execution of the cell search and selection procedure as well as acquiring 
initial system information is essential for the UE before taking further steps to 
communicate with the network. For this reason, it is important to take a closer look at 
this fundamental physical layer procedure. This section focuses on the cell-search 
scheme defined for LTE and the next chapter describes reception of the essential 
system information.
As in 3G (WCDMA), LTE uses a hierarchical cell-search procedure in which an LTE radio cell is identified by a cell identity, which is comparable to the scrambling code that is used to separate base stations and cells in
 WCDMA. To avoid the need for expensive and complicated network and cell planning, 504 physical layer cell identities of is sufficiently large. With a hierarchical cell search scheme, these identities are divided into 168 unique cell layer identity groups in
 the physical layer, in which each 
group consists of three physical layer identities. To remember this hierarchical 
principle, consider the example of first names and surnames. According to statistics, 
the most common English surname is “Smith”, which corresponds to physical layer cell identity group 0. The second most common surname is “Johnson”, which represents the physical layer cell identity group 1. This example can be extended to the last group, which
 would be “Rose”. The most common male first names are “James”, “John”, or “Robert” and female names are “Mary”, “Patricia”, and “Linda”. Each first name represents one of the three physical layer identities. This information is now transmitted using two different
 signals, generated by Layer 1.
The two signals, carrying the physical layer identity and the physical layer cell identity 
group, are the primary and the secondary synchronization signals respectively. This 
means that the complete cell search procedure consists of two steps to identify the 
cells’ identity as shown Graphically in the Figure below:
![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1289773850048/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Figure%20C.bmp)
### Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS)
The UE first looks for the primary synchronization signal (PSS) which is transmitted in 
the last OFDM symbol of the first time slot of the first subframe (subframe 0) in a radio 
frame. This enables the UE to acquire the slot boundary independently from the 
chosen cyclic prefix selected for this cell. Based on the downlink frame structure (Type 
1, FDD). The primary synchronization signal is transmitted 

twice per radio frame, so it is repeated in subframe 5 (in time slot 11). This enables the 
UE to get time synchronized on a 5 ms basis, which was selected to simplify the 
required inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements. LTE must accommodate 
handover to and from other radio access technologies, such as GSM/GPRS/EDGE, 
WCDMA/HSPA or CDMA®2000 1xRTT/1xEV-DO.
### Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS)
After the mobile has found the 5 ms timing, the second step is to obtain the radio frame timing and the cells’ group identity. This information can be found from the SSS. In the xtime domain, the SSS is
 transmitted in the symbol before the PSS . The SSS also has 5 ms periodicity, which means it is transmitted in the first and sixth subframes (subframes 0 and 5) as shown in the Figure below. Like the PSS, the SSS is transmitted on 62 of the 72 reserved subcarriers
 around the DC subcarrier.

## LTE Cell selection and reselection criteria
![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1289774169230/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Line.bmp)
The previous section described how initial cell selection will work and the difference between LTE FDD and TD-LTE. However, only when specific criteria are fulfilled is the UE allowed to camp on that cell. These criteria
 for cell selection as well as cell reselection for LTE are specified in [3]. It is further illustrated by a description of the two procedures: In the initial cell selection procedure, as described in the previous sections, no knowledge about RF channels carrying
 an E-UTRA signal is available at the UE. In that case the UE scans the supported E-UTRA frequency bands to find a suitable cell. Only the cell with the strongest signal per carrier will be selected by the UE. The second procedure relies on information about
 carrier frequencies and optionally cell parameters received and stored from previously-detected cells. If no suitable cell is found using the stored information the UE starts with the initial cell selection procedure. ***S*** is
 the criterion defined to decide if the cell is still suitable . This criterion is fulfilled when the cell selection receive level is ![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1294072764682/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Cell%20Reselection%201.bmp) is
 computed based on the Equation below:
![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1294072802866/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Cell%20Reselection%202.bmp)
**![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1294072864975/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Cell%20Reselection%20a.bmp)is the measured receive level value for this cell, i.e. the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP).  **
        This measured value is the linear average over the power of the resource elements that carry the cell specific 
        reference signals over the considered measurement bandwidth. Consequently, it depends on the configured 
        signal bandwidth. In the case of receiver diversity configured for the UE, the reported value will be equivalent 
        to the linear average of the power values of all diversity branches.
![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1294072892880/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Cell%20Reselection%20b.bmp)is
 the minimum required receive level in this cell, given in dBm. This value is signaled as 
**QrxLevmin** by higher layers as part of the System Information Block Type 1 (SIB Type 1). **QrxLevmin** is
           
        calculated based on the value provided within the information element (-70 and -22) multiplied with factor 2 in  
        dBm.
**![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1294072926662/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Cell%20Reselection%20c.bmp) is an offset to **Q**rxlevmin that is only taken into account as a result of a periodic search for a  **
        higher priority PLMN while camped normally in a Visitor PLMN (VPLMN). This offset is based on the  
        information element provided within the SIB Type 1, taking integer values between (1…8) also multiplied by a 
        factor of 2 in dB. This gives a wider range by keeping the number of bit transmitting this information. The 
        offset is defined to avoid “ping-pong” between different PLMNs. If it is not available then **Qrxlevminoffset**is 
        assumed to be 0 dB.
![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1294072981358/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Cell%20Reselection%20d.bmp)is
 a maximum function as shown in Equation 5. Whatever parameter is higher, 
**        P**EMAX- **P**UMAXor
 0, is the value used for **P**Compensation. **P**EMAX[dBm]
 is the maximum power a UE is           
        allowed to use in this cell, whereas ***P**UMAX* [dBm] is the  maximum transmit power
 of an UE according to the        
        power class the UE  belongs too. At the moment only one power class is defined for LTE, which corresponds                 
   
        to Power Class 3 in WCDMA that specifies +23 dBm.  ***P**EMAX* is
 defined by higher layers and corresponds to  
       the parameter **P-MAX** defined in
 [2]. Based on this relationship, **PEMAX** can take values between -30 to +33 
       dBm. Only  when **PEMAX** >
 +23 dBm **P**Compensation is it considered when calculating **Srxlev**.
 The **P-MAX**
       information element (IE) is part of SIB Type 1 as well as in the "**RadioResourceConfigCommon"** IE,
 which 
       is part of the SIB Type 2.
As explained above, all parameters except for **Qrxlevmeas** are provided via system information. In a real network a UE will receive several
 cells perhaps from different network operators. The UE only knows after reading the SIB Type 1 if this cell belongs to its operator’s network (PLMN Identity). First the UE will look for the strongest cell per carrier, then for the PLMN identity by decoding
 the SIB Type 1 to decide if this PLMN is a suitable identity. Afterwards it will compute the S criterion and decide for a suitable cell or not.
![](https://sites.google.com/site/lteencyclopedia/_/rsrc/1289323097151/cell-reselection-procedures-in-lte/Cells.bmp)
The Figure above shows one possible scenario in a real network. Assume that the UE belongs to
 network operator 1. There are two other carriers also operating an LTE network but of course at different frequencies. The terminal receives all base stations but
 at different power levels. Based on the above definition the UE will select the strong cell for each carrier . Using this the UE will start with network operator 3 and figure
 out after decoding the SIB Type 1 that the PLMN saved on the USIM does not match to the transmitted one. From this information it will stop with its attempt and proceed
 to the next strongest signal, which is operator 2 . Now the PLMN does not correspond so the UE will continue with signal 3 (green) – and the PLMN will match.
 The UE continues to use the information in SIB Type 1 and Type 2 to compute the cell selection criteria. In this example, the parameters transferred and belonging to eNB1
 do not fulfill S > 0 where the UE will move along with demodulating and decoding the information provided by eNB2. S > 0 is fulfilled and the UE starts camping on this cell.
