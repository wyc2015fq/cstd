1.But a team’s culture isn’t just the way in which team members write
code or treat one another: it’s a set of shared experiences, values,
and goals that is unique to every engineering team we’ve ever been
on or observed. The founding members of a team or company
define the biggest part of a team’s culture, but it will continue to
change and develop over the life of the team.
一个团队的文化并不仅仅是大家写代码的方式或者是相处的方式；
团队的文化应该是对于每个团队的成员都相同的：分享经验、价值和目标
等一系列的东西，这些东西应该都是我们已经达到的或者预计要达到的东西。
团队或者公司的最初的创立成员定义了团队文化中的最大的一部分，但是团队
文化在团队的整个生命周期中是会不断的变化和发展的。
2.If your team doesn’t value your culture, not only is it difficult to build
a strong team identity and collective pride in your work, but also
it’s very easy for a newcomer to change your culture into something
that sucks.
如果你的团队没有形成团队文化，那么这不仅仅会导致很难去建立认同感和
集体荣誉感，并且很容易导致一个新加入团队的人把团队的的文化变的很糟糕。
3.The first mistake most engineers make is to assume the team leader
curates the culture of a team.
大多数工程师犯的第一个错误就是认为团队的领导者组织团队的文化。
4.The only way to make sure new team members will be
a culture fit is to interview for it.
唯一的保证新员工适应团队文化的办法就是在面试的时候考察他是否适合。
5.In the software world, a great deal of creative thinking is required of
engineers working on a product, and if you want a great product, you
need great engineers. If you want great engineers to do great work
 (and to stick around), you need to create a culture for them that allows
them to safely share ideas and have a voice in the decision-making process.
在软件的世界里，工程师在完成一个产品的时候需要具有创造性的伟大想法，
如果你想做一个伟大的产品，那么你需要一群伟大的工程师。如果你需要伟大
的工程师去完成伟大的产品（并保持下去），你需要创建一个文化氛围让他们
可以安全的交流分享想法，并且可以在关键性的决定的时候可以发表自己的看法。
6.If your team has a culture of
chest thumping and yelling and screaming at one another, the only
people you’ll attract (and retain) are aggressive types who feel right
at home in this environment composed of strong individual egos
(in fact, most of the women we know find this kind of environment
especially off-putting). If you create a culture of HRT where team
members treat one another kindly and take the effort to give
constructive criticism, you’ll not only attract a much larger set
of people, but you’ll also spend a great deal more of your energy
writing software.
7.Constructive criticism is essential to the growth and development of
any engineering team. It requires a certain amount of self-confidence
to take any kind of criticism, and we think constructive criticism
is the easiest kind to receive. On the downside, it’s a lot harder
to give someone constructive criticism than to simply lambast her
or ridicule something she did.
8.Calm, easygoing cultures built on respect are more vulnerable
to disruption by aggressive people than aggressive cultures are
vulnerable to disruption from more easygoing people.
9.A good general rule around communication is to include as few
people as necessary in synchronous communication (like meetings),
and to go for a broader audience in asynchronous communication
(like email).
10.Five simple rules for running a meeting:
1).   Only invite people who absolutely need to be there.
2).   Have an agenda and distribute it well before the 
meeting starts.
3).   End the meeting early if you’ve accomplished the 
meeting’s goals.
4).   Keep the meeting on track.
5).   Try to schedule the meeting near other interrupt 
points in your day (e.g., lunch, end of day).
