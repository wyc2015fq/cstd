- Queuing: The judge is so busy that it can't judge your solution at the moment. Usually you just need to wait a while because our judge server is powered by IBM and Intel
 Xeon :-)
- Compiling : Your solution is being compiled to binary form by specified compiler.
- Running : Your program is running on the server and fed with input data if necessary.
- Accepted (AC) : Yes, your program is correct. You did a good job!
- Presentation Error (PE) : Your program's output format is not exactly the same as required by the problem, although the output is correct. This usually means the existence
 of omitted or extra blank characters (white spaces, tab characters and/or new line characters) between any two non-blank characters, and/or blank lines (a line consisting of only blank characters) between any two non-blank lines. Trailing blank characters
 at the end of each line and trailing blank lines at the of output are not considered format errors. Check the output for spaces, blank lines, etc. against the problem's output specification.
- Wrong Answer (WA) : Correct solution not reached for the inputs. The inputs and outputs that we use to test the programs are not public (it is recomendable to get accustomed
 to a true contest dynamic :-)
- Runtime Error (RE) : Your program failed during the execution and you will receive the hints for the reasons. Here are part of the hints and their meanings.
- *ACCESS_VIOLATION* Your program tried to read from or write to a address for which it does not have the appropriate access.
- *ARRAY_BOUNDS_EXCEEDED* Your program tried to access an array element that is out of bounds and the underlying hardware supports bounds checking.
- *FLOAT_DENORMAL_OPERAND* One of the operands in a floating-point operation is denormal. A denormal value is one that is too small to represent as a standard floating-point
 value.
- *FLOAT_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO* The thread tried to divide a floating-point value by a floating-point divisor of zero.
- *FLOAT_OVERFLOW* The exponent of a floating-point operation is greater than the magnitude allowed by the corresponding type.
- *FLOAT_UNDERFLOW* The exponent of a floating-point operation is less than the magnitude allowed by the corresponding type.
- *INTEGER_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO* Your program tried to divide an integer value by an integer divisor of zero.
- *INTEGER_OVERFLOW* The result of an integer operation caused a carry out of the most significant bit of the result.
- *STACK_OVERFLOW* Your program used up its stack.
- *......* Other runtime errors.

- Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) : Your program tried to run during too much time.
- Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE) : Your program tried to use more memory than the judge default settings.
- Output Limit Exceeded (OLE) : Your program tried to write too much information. This usually occurs if it goes into a infinite loop.
- Compilation Error (CE) : The compiler fails to compile your program. Warning messages are not considered errors. Click on the judge's reply to see the warning and error
 messages produced by the compiler.
- System Error: The judge cannot run your program. One example is that your program requires much more memory than hardware limitation.
- Out Of Contest Time : This message can only appear during a contest, if a program is submitted out of contest time.
