# Lie group decomposition

# In [mathematics](wiki/Mathematics), Lie group decompositions, named after [Sophus Lie](wiki/Sophus_Lie), are used to analyse the structure of [Lie groups](wiki/Lie_group) and associated objects, by showing how they are built up out of [subgroups](wiki/Subgroup). They are essential technical tools in the [representation theory](wiki/Representation_theory) of Lie groups and [Lie algebras](wiki/Lie_algebra); they can also be used to study the [algebraic topology](wiki/Algebraic_topology) of such groups and associated [homogeneous spaces](wiki/Homogeneous_space). Since the use of Lie group methods became one of the standard techniques in twentieth century mathematics, many phenomena can now be referred back to decompositions.

# The same ideas are often applied to Lie groups, Lie algebras, [algebraic groups](wiki/Algebraic_group) and [p-adic number](wiki/P-adic_number) analogues, making it harder to summarise the facts into a unified theory.

# List of decompositions
- The [Bruhat decomposition](wiki/Bruhat_decomposition)*G* = *BWB* of a semisimple algebraic group into double cosets of a [Borel subgroup](wiki/Borel_subgroup) can be regarded as a general expression of the principle of [Gauss–Jordan elimination](wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Jordan_elimination), which generically writes a matrix as the product of an upper triangular matrix with a lower triangular matrix—but with exceptional cases. It is related to the Schubert cell decomposition of [Grassmannians](wiki/Grassmannian): see [Weyl group](wiki/Weyl_group) for more details. 
- The [Cartan decomposition](wiki/Cartan_decomposition) writes a semisimple real Lie algebra as the sum of eigenspaces of a [Cartan involution](wiki/Cartan_involution). 
- The [Iwasawa decomposition](wiki/Iwasawa_decomposition)*G* = *KAN* of a semisimple group *G* as the product of compact, abelian, and nilpotent subgroups generalises the way a square real matrix can be written as a product of an [orthogonal matrix](wiki/Orthogonal_matrix) and an [upper triangular matrix](wiki/Upper_triangular_matrix) (a consequence of [Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization](wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_orthogonalization)). 
- The [Langlands decomposition](wiki/Langlands_decomposition)*P* = *MAN* writes a parabolic subgroup *P* of a Lie group as the product of semisimple, abelian, and nilpotent subgroups. 
- The [Levi decomposition](wiki/Levi_decomposition) writes a finite dimensional Lie algebra as a [semidirect product](wiki/Semidirect_product) of a normal [solvable](wiki/Solvable_Lie_algebra) subalgebra by a [semisimple](wiki/Semisimple_Lie_algebra) subalgebra. 
- The [Polar decomposition](wiki/Polar_decomposition)*G* = *KAK* writes a semisimple Lie group *G* in terms of a maximal compact subgroup *K* and an abelian subgroup *A*.

**Matrix factorization,**

*factorization of matrices*



Factorizations of matrices over a field are useful in quite a number of problems, both analytical and numerical; for example, in the (numerical) solution of linear equations and eigenvalue problems. A few well-known factorizations are listed below.
