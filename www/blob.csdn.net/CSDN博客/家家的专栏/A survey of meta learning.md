Paper reading: a perspective view and survey of meta-learning

Goal: build a **self-adaptive learning **algorithm.

Idea: improve the learning bias dynamically through experience by the continuous accumulation of meta-knowledge

虽然不同学者对于meta learning定义不同，但是有一点是相同的：How can we exploit knowledge about learning (i.e., meta-knowledge) to improve the performance of learning algorithms. 

Meta learning advocates the need for continuous adaptation of the learner at different levels of abstraction.
