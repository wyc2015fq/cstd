|**CSE 704 Seminar in Manifold and Subspace Learning**Spring 2010**Instructor:**Dr. Yun (Raymond) Fu**Course Webpage:**[http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~yunfu/course/CSE704FU_Spring2010.htm](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~yunfu/course/CSE704FU_Spring2010.htm)**Times:**Wednesday2pm—4:30pm**Location:**  Bell Hall 224 **Office Hours:**Right after the seminar or by appointment**Office Hours Location:**Bell Hall 241**Course Overview**Designing subspace learning algorithms using manifold criterion and models is a rapid emerging area in computer vision and pattern recognition. This seminar will cover extensive discussions on the state-of-the-art literature in manifold and subspace learning. Topics, which will be well balanced between the basic theoretical background and practical applications, include manifold modeling, dimensionality reduction, discriminant analysis, component analysis, kernelization, feature extraction/representation, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, etc. The involved applications are mainly derived from the imaging field, such as biometrics, image/video processing, machine vision, and human-computer interaction. We will read and discuss papers on the listed topic together.Guest lecturers will be invited to present some topics if funding is available for honoraria or expenses.**Goals and Grading**The default grading is Grading is P/F. Students will be required to make in-class presentations and lead the discussions. By special request of letter grading, some students may finish a final project to study an existing algorithm or invent new algorithms in any related topics. Note that participation is also considered as a factor for final grading. Students can be absence for particular reasons (by instructor’s permission). **Prerequisites**Fundamental knowledge and some experiences of pattern classification, image processing, and computer vision.**Course Topics and Schedules**| | | |
