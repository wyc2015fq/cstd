This article provides information on how to clean install the Ubuntu Linux operating system on your Dell PC.



### 1. Do you need to Install Ubuntu on your Dell PC?



If you need to install Ubuntu on your Dell PC there are a few things you will need to decide and have before you proceed with the guide below.


Note: If you install an operating system other than the one that shipped with your system, then you do so at your own risk. Dell can't certify that the hardware will be compatible and we may not be able to support the system in
 that configuration.


**Have you checked your system type is one of those certified by Canonical as being suitable for Ubuntu?**
- If not, then please go to [the Canonical site](http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/make/Dell/?category=Desktop&category=Laptop&category=Netbook) and check if your model has been tested by Canonical and is suitable.


- If you have and it's supported on this list then carry on.



Note: If your system did not ship with Ubuntu and you have an issue that requires Technical Support Assistance to resolve. You may be asked to return the system to the condition it shipped from Dell and advise if the issue continues
 at that point. If it doesn't then there would be limited support possible at that point.


Have you got a copy of the latest DVD or USB installation media from canonical?**These will include the latest updates and fixes for this operating system**.


You will need to decide which release you want.
- The latest Release comes with limited support by Canonical. **Usually about 9 months.**


- The older Release is more stable and has extended support by Canonical. **Usually several years guaranteed updates for your release**.


You can download the appropriate Ubuntu ISO from [Canonical](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
