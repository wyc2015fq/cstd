有关Docker的知识和经验可能对您的职业非常有价值，特别是在2018年。最新的统计数据和数据显示了一些惊人的数字，例如需要这些技能的工作的薪水高于美国境内公共职位董事会上发布的大多数工作，以及年薪专业人士可能高达10万美元。

这就是为什么你应该在2018年学习Docker并将你的职业生涯提升到一个新的水平，没有比开始使用一些免费资源更好的原因。


我一直在分享一些免费资源，例如书籍和课程，相当长的一段时间，如果您是第一次来这里，您可能需要通过搜索框来查找关于[Java](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/11/top-5-free-java-courses-for-beginners.html#axzz4zuIICRs9), [Spring](http://www.java67.com/2017/11/top-5-free-core-spring-mvc-courses-learn-online.html), [Kotlin](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/5-courses-to-learn-kotlin-programming-java-android.html#axzz56R4AatoQ), [DevOps](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/6-free-maven-and-jenkins-online-courses-for-java-developers.html), [Eclipse](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html), [Jenkins](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/6-free-maven-and-jenkins-online-courses-for-java-developers.html), [Rails](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-ruby-and-rails-courses-to-learn-online.html), [PHP 和 MySQL](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-php-and-mysql-courses-for-web-developers.html), [Oracle](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-oracle-and-microsoft-sql-server-online-courses.html), [Linux](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-linux-unix-courses-for-programmers-learn-online.html)的免费在线课程等。

Docker has become the *de facto* standard for defining and running containers in the Linux operating system. Kubernetes is Red Hat's choice for container orchestration.

![best course to learn Docker](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k2aunTn7vKg/WoLdh_EvjhI/AAAAAAAAKs4/uhVqbujyl4A7gI_q5Z-fn_lYEwpKJk9jQCEwYBhgL/s400/Docker%2BDeep%2BDive%2BPluralsight%2Bcourse.png)

OpenShift, built upon Docker, Kubernetes, and other [open source](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/top-10-open-source-frameworks-and-libraries-java-web-developers.html) software projects, provides Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for the ultimate in deploying applications within containers.

This is an Official Red Hat course about containers using Docker running on [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/5-courses-to-learn-shell-scripting-in-linux.html).

In this course, Jim Rigsbee, a curriculum architect for Red Hat Training, will introduce you to container technology using Docker running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

You will also learn theory and all concepts are clearly demonstrated on the command line.

And the best part of this course is that no prior knowledge of [Docker](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-docker-courses-for-java-and-DevOps-engineers.html) or [Linux](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-linux-unix-courses-for-programmers-learn-online.html) is required.

### **10. [Docker and Containers: The Big Picture](http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fdocker-containers-big-picture)**

These two courses from Pluralsight are not really a free; you need a Pluarlsight membership to get this course, and monthly membership costs around $29 and annual membership cost around $299.  

I know, we all love free stuff, but you will not only get access to this course, but over 5000 courses as well, so it's definitely the money well spent. 

I have an annual membership because I have to learn a lot of new stuff all the times. Even if you are not a member, you can get this course for free by signing a [free trial](http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn). Pluralsight provides 10-day free trial with no obligation.

That's all about some of the **free Docker container courses for Java developers**. It's one of the essential skill if you are developing a mobile application or web application hence, I suggest every application developer learn Docker in 2018. You will not only learn an essential skill but also take your career to next level, given high demand of Docker specialist and developer who knows Docker.
