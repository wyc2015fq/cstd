**       在高压力工作下你会很容易生病，尤其是有过高压工作状态下经历生病的人，这会使得你再一次患病。**

        压力来自于内心的恐慌，是由心底产生的焦虑。换到一个新的工作环境、接触新的事物，要快速地适应那里的一切的确是一个不小的挑战。

        如果你到了一个新的工作环境，你需要快速的了解公司目前正在进行的项目，然后快速的投入到开发中。如果你正好遇到项目需要快速做功能快发，而你是补别人的空缺，这样的挑战无疑是最令人头疼的。

        你怕耽误项目的进度，怕自己对系统哪里的业务还不熟悉，这些都会让你感到紧张。我是一名开发，而我最近刚换了工作正处于焦虑阶段，因为需要厘清业务和接口，还有查看大量的需求文档，这些都让人倍感压力。更何况，我是从一间很自由轻松的公司过去的。以前我可以上午9、10点钟去公司，不用打卡，下午5点左右就可以走；但是现在，我需要每天早起去挤公交，背个破电脑满世界的跑，必须早点去打卡签到。这一周是我正式到新公司上班，之前去过不过没怎么做实际的东西，都是搭建环境之类的。

        然而这周，我就要接替上一个人做的系统功能，然后进行新的开发。做技术久了就会感觉重要的不是编码，而是业务，的确如此。**代码谁都可以写，但是懂业务才是你真正的工作经历。**

        我很不幸，年前因为当时工作压力的缘故患了十二指肠溃疡，不过在2015年春节前已经治好了。可是，就在昨天灾难又降临了，还是因为工作压力。早上因为赶时间没顾得上吃早餐，结果下午胃疼的难受，晚上也没有休息好，今天延续昨天的痛苦，连今天的会议也是无精打采的。有句话说的是，“身体是革命的本钱”，没有身体一切莫谈。一个人如果身体没有任何毛病，他可以做他想做的事，去他想去的地方；一旦身体出了毛病，哪还有心情去欣赏风花雪月啊。所以，一切都不如健康来得实在。

        健康无价，再多钱也买不回来，每个人必须要学会调节焦虑，然后从中获得教训。

        焦虑真的可以让你生病，不要忽视它的存在。我想自己做一个自我调节，下面摘录几篇有关焦虑和处理焦虑的外文：



# How to Tell If Anxiety Is Making You Feel Ill

From：[http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/signs/feeling-ill](http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/signs/feeling-ill)



Anxiety is a mental health disorder. When people think of anxiety, they think of worrying and stress. They think of fears and a feeling as though something is going to go wrong. Anxiety is seen in thoughts and actions.


But anxiety has a tremendous physical component, and one of the key contributors to those physical sensations is long term stress. Stress can have a tremendous impact on your health, and one of the most common conditions is feeling ill.


## Feeling Ill from Anxiety?


You may be coming down with a cold. You may be coming down with a serious disease. Or you may just have anxiety. It's sometimes hard for people to believe that feeling ill can come from anxiety, but it's a very real experience that affects many people.


If you haven't yet, take my 7 minute anxiety test to find out if you're likely feeling ill from anxiety. [Click
 here to start](http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety-test/).


## Anxiety Can Cause Feelings of Illness


The stress from anxiety can cause feelings of very genuine sickness. These feelings often mimic the way illnesses make you feel. Your stomach can feel like it's rumbling and you may even feel nauseated. Feeling sick may be a sign that you've fallen ill, but
 it can also be a clear sign of anxiety.


While feeling sick can be the only physical symptom of anxiety, there are often others. [Take
 my 7 minute anxiety test](http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety-test/) to get an idea of what symptoms you have are the result of anxiety and what you can do to stop it.

## Why Does Anxiety Cause a Sick Feeling?


In general, that sick feeling is caused by a number of different factors. Just a few of which include:
- Standard Stress Response – Scientists believe that nausea, and some of
 the common feelings of illness, are the result of issues with serotonin and adrenaline, which go haywire when you're suffering from anxiety. It's likely that there is an evolutionary component, where during times of fear, your gut sends a message to your brain
 that you should be frightened using the feeling of nausea.
- Gut and Abdominal Pressure – Anxiety also causes a great deal of pressure
 on the stomach and guts, including stomach acids, digestion, and more. All of these throw off the way your body processes food and waters, and can cause you to feel like someone is going wrong in your stomach.
- Mild Illness – Your body fights off germs every day. Anxiety can weaken
 your immune system, increasing the risk of suffering from mild illness. This is much less common, but may contribute to a feeling of nausea and sickness.


Feeling ill is something that often causes concern. Some people feel so sick that they vomit or experience profound nausea that keeps them away from their activities.


Some people experience more than just nausea as well. They may experience other symptoms that are similar to catching a cold or flu. They may feel like their glands are swollen, or their tongue is dry. They may feel lightheaded. They may even cough or experience
 severe stomach discomfort, like indigestion.

## Are You Sick?


When anxiety is causing these symptoms, they're not dangerous. Anxiety is simply your body's misfiring of the body's natural fight or flight response, and the way your body reacts is designed to make sure that you know you're supposed to be fearful.


The problem isn't the signals themselves, the problem is that you're experiencing them all the time, often when it is inconvenient. People feel these symptoms for different reasons:
- Situational Illness Feelings – Some people experience anxiety as a result
 of various situations. For example, before a test, before a first date, before proposing, etc.
- Chronic Illness Feelings – Long term, chronic anxiety can also cause you
 to feel sick. This is very often indicative of an anxiety disorder.


Situational anxiety is actually natural. It's inconvenient, but it's natural. Back in school, if you felt severe illness before a big test, it's because you genuinely feared that test. While tests shouldn't provide that fear, the reaction is not unexpected.


Feelings of chronic illness from anxiety can be even more problematic, because when your anxiety won't go away, the feeling of being ill won't go away either. It becomes something that makes you feel worse about your health, saps your energy, and can ruin each
 and every day.

## Temporarily Relief for the Sick Feeling


Most over the counter medicines that calm the stomach are mildly effective at relieving most of the sick feeling. Even though it's caused by anxiety, some of the symptoms can be relieved with medicines that relieve some nausea.


For issue like swollen glands, treating them can be a bit more complicated. That's because your glands aren't actually swollen. Swollen glands (and a clogged throat, and other common anxiety complaints) are actually a symptom of over-sensitization. Your body
 is so attuned to the way you feel that it starts to believe that it feels problems, even though the problems aren't actually there.


The only way to cure that is to cure your anxiety, and to do that you need to start to understand your anxiety better.


I have helped thousands of people that feel sick day in and day out from anxiety by starting them out with my [7

 around us better.



Being constantly under pressure to do well can be a burden. You have responsibilities in your life that must be taken can of. You need to change your approach and develop new routines in your life. Also provide different approach's to help solve different solutions.
 You need to provide less tension in your life, and bring more joy into it. You can do these things, you just have to learn to take charge in your life. When you take charge of things and situations change. You can never expect things to change by themselves.






## Instructions

Take a break to recollect your thoughts. Take a timeout and recollect yourself. Whatever it is, you need a vacation from it. Whether that vacation is five minutes, a day, or weeks. Take a vacation and find something peaceful. Keep your mind of things for awhile.
 Find something relaxing that you can enjoy. That can be a song, a cold beer, or a walk on the beach. Whatever you need, find something that can help you regain control of your mind. A peace of mind can change a lot of what you can do. You can't expect to solve

Develop a swagger. Establish your confidence to get things done. Give yourself props for the things you've accomplished. Allow personal accomplishment motivate you. Allow failure to do that as well. Consider the pros and let that influence you as well. Peace
 of find, financial gain, whatever that is there to help you establish the confidence needed. Use the benefits to help motivate you and give you the confidence needed to overcome adversity. Sometimes to establish your swagger you'll need to learn to have fun
 again. Don't take everything so seriously, you'll learn to relax and get things done more efficiently. Learn to laugh at problems and not let them consume you.



- 4



Take charge of a situation, don't let a situation take charge of you. Be aggressive and have that attack demeanor in you. Someone that stands up and takes charge of what is happening can control a lot. If you lets problem come to you, rather than stepping up,
 it can sometimes expand into bigger ones. Then this adds more stress and pressure into your life. Be a go getter and have that mentality. Don't avoid things, take charge before situations become stressful problems.



- 5



Focus on your strengths and forget your weaknesses. Sometimes when you're consumed in what you can't do, it takes away a lot of you. Everyone has weaknesses, so just forget them. Focus on your strengths and the things you do well. Use your strengths and apply
 them into your daily life. You'll discover it becomes a lot easier when you use this strategy. It helps deal with your problems easier and more effectively. Apply your people skills when dealing with people. Apple your talents into your strategies.



- 6



Manage your time better. Don't become so consumed into your problems, otherwise you're going to feel trapped. Sometimes you need to take a step back, and learn to let things play out as well. You don't have do everything constantly, it's not healthy actually.
 You need breaks along with time to just sit back enjoy the things in your life. You can't have a obsessive mindset of feeling like everything needs fixed. Your mind will be sharper if you're not handling too many problems at a time. It will help you deal with
 situations much better if you learn to take a slower approach, along with a patient one. More importantly your time shouldn't be consumed into just your problems.


You should not make a habit of creating problems when there aren't any. A bad habit a lot of people have, when dealing with enough stress in their lives. You'll learn to overcome pressure effectively and when you apply more happiness in your life. Things that
 give you passion and love should be applied into your daily life. Sometimes you need to take a break from problems, to have a better attack when dealing with them. Don't be consumed in things, otherwise you'll provide yourself with more pressure and stress.



- 7



Ask for help. You don't have to deal with things all alone. Help is a good thing, a great thing to have. Two minds are better than one anyways. Lean on others when needed and it will help you out in variety of different situations. Whether that is a advice,
 favors, or just a helpful hand.
