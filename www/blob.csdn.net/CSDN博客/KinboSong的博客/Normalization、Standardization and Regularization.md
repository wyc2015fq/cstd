1、Normalization
On one hand,normalization rescales the values into a range of [0,1]. This might be useful in some cases where all parameters need to have the same positive scale. However, the outliers from the data set are lost.
On the other hand,In Linear Algebra, Normalization seems to refer to the dividing of a vector by its length.
2、Standardization
Standardization rescales data to have a mean ()
 of 0 and standard deviation ()
 of 1 (unit variance).
For most applications standardization is recommended.
3、Regularization
regularization is a process of introducing
 additional information in order to solve an [ill-posed
 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ill-posed_problem) or to prevent [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).
