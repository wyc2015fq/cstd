### 2.1 sets
- definition
- ways to express 
- roster method
- set builder notation
- interval notation

- singletonset(单元素集)
- venn diagrams(维恩图)
- subsets 
- subsets definition
- ∀x(x∈A->x∈B)

- the size of a set 
- finite set(有限集)
- infinite set(无限集)
- cardinality(基数)
- power set P(S) : the power set of S is the set of all subsets of the set S. The power set of S is denoted by P(S).

- Cartesian Products 
- ordered collection
- Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B denoted by A×B, is the set of all orderer pairs, where a∈A and b∈B
- A×B = {(a,b)|a∈A∧b∈B}
- the Cartesian product of the sets A1, A2, A3. …, An

- using set notation with quantifiers
- truth sets and quantifiers

### 2.2 set operations
- A∪B
- A∩B
- two sets are called disjoint if their intersection is the empty set.
- difference of A and B A-B={x|x∈A∧x∉B}
- complement of A with respect to U(A关于U的补集)
- set indentities(好多laws不再列举)(这些规则用逻辑演算的方法可以证明，看例子)
- generalized unions and intersections
- computer representation of sets

### 2.3 functions
- definition of function
- domain(定义域) codomain(陪域:比值域要大)
- preimage(原象) range or image
- if f is a function from A to B we say that f maps A to B
- One-to-One(单射)  Onto(满射 surjection)
- bijection(双射)
- increasing  strictly increasing
- decreasing  strictly decreasing
- inverse function(反函数)
- 复合函数
- the graphs of functions 
- floor function
- ceiling function

- partial functions
