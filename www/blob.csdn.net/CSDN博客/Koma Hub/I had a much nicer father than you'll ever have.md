                Bill was 18 years old. Although he had left school he preferred living in the comfort of his parents' home. He said that he was trying to find a job but there never seemed to be one that he thought good enough for him.
      Bill's father, Mr. James, didn't see him very often because he worked quite a distance from home and was in the habit of leaving home early before Bill got up; and when he got home in the evenings, Bill was usually somewhere else, amusing himself with a few of his friends.
      But Mr. James sometimes saw Bill at weekends, and then he was always angry with him. He used to say to him, "Why are you never at home in the evening? Who ever would give you a job with your dirty hair?" and so on. "But father," Bill said, "all my friends are like me nowadays, and if I changed, I wouldn't be popular with them anymore."
      One Saturday morning, Mr. James said to Bill while they were having their usual argument, "Bill, you should be ashamed to live like that. I was brought up quite differently. When I was at your age, my father never allowed me to do any of the things that you do all the time. I was forbidden to stay out till midnight and come down to breakfast at nine; I was not allowed to grow a beard, nor wear gold chains."
      He went on and on till Bill said kindly, "Poor father, my grandfather died before I was born. I never met him. But he must have been a terrible old man."
      "Not at all!" Mr. James objected angrily. "I had a much nicer father than you'll ever have!"
