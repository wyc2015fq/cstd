Execute the following from the src/ directory:
    ./configure    # try to figure out all implementation differences
    cd lib         # build the basic library that all programs need
    make           # use "gmake" everywhere on BSD/OS systems
    cd ../libfree  # continue building the basic library
    make
    cd ../libroute # only if your system supports 4.4BSD style routing sockets
    make           # only if your system supports 4.4BSD style routing sockets
    cd ../libxti   # only if your system supports XTI
    make           # only if your system supports XTI
    cd ../intro    # build and test a basic client program
    make daytimetcpcli
    ./daytimetcpcli 127.0.0.1
