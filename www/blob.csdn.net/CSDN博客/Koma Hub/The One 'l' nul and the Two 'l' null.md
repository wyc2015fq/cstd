Memorize this little rhyme to recall the correct terminology for pointers and ASCII zero:
- The one "l" NUL ends an ASCII string,
- The two "l" NULL points to no thing.
Apologies to Ogden Nash, but the three "l" nulll means check your spelling. The ASCII character with the bit pattern of zero is termed a "NUL". The special pointer value that means the pointer points nowhere is "NULL". The two terms are not interchangeable in meaning.
