**You can't have any of these:**
- a function can't return a function, so you'll never see foo()()
- a function can't return an array, so you'll never see foo()[]
- an array can't hold a function, so you'll never see foo[]()
**You can have any of these:**
- a function returning a pointer to a function is allowed: int (* fun())();
- a function returning a pointer to an array is allowed: int (* foo())[]
- an array holding pointers to functions is allowed: int (*foo[])()
- an array can hold other arrays, so you'll frequently see int foo[][]
