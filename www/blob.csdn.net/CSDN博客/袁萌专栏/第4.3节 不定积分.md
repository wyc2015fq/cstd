**4.3 INDEFINITE  INTEGRALS**
The FundamentalTheorem
 of Calculus shows that every continuous function *f*hasat
 least one antiderivative, namely*F(x)*=___*f(t)dt.*Actually,*f*hasinfinitely
 many antiderivatives, but any two antiderivatives of fdiffer only by a constant. This is an important fact aboutantiderivatives, which we state as a theorem.
**THEOREM1**
*Letf be a real function whose domain is an open interval I.*
(i)I*f F(x) isan antiderivative of f(x), then F(x) + C is an antiderivative of f(x)for every real number C.*
(ii)I*f F(x) andG(x) are two antiderivatives of f(x), then F(x) - G(x) is constantfor all x in I. That is ,*
*G(x)= F(x) +C*
*forsome real number C.*
DiscussionParts (i) and (ii) together show that if we can
 find oneantiderivative *F(x)*of*f(x)*,then
 the family of functions
*F(x) +C*,    *C*=a
 real number
givesall antiderivatives of
*f*(*x*).We
 see from Figure 4.3.1 that the graph of *F(x)+C*isjust the graph of
*F(x)*movedvertically by a distance*C.*Thegraphs of
*F(x)*and*F(x)+C*havethe
 same slopes at every point *x*.For example, let
*f(x)*=3*x*².Then
*F(x)*=*x*3is
 an antiderivative of 3*x*²because
But*x*3+6
 and *x*3－___arealso
 antiderivatives of 3x². In fact, x3+*C*isan
 antiderivative of 3x²foreach real number
*C.*Theorem1 shows that 3*x*²hasno
 other antiderivatives.

PROOF We prove (i) by differentiating,
Part(ii) follows from a theorem in Section 3.7 on curve sketching.
 If afunction has derivative zero on *I*,then the function is constant on*I.*Thedifference
*F(x)-G(x)*hasderivative
*f(x)- f(x)*=0and is therefore constant. We used this fact in the proof of theFundamental
 Theorem of Calculus.
Incomputing integrals of
*f*,we usually work with the family of all antiderivatives of
*f.*Weshall call this whole family of functions the
*indefiniteintegral*of*f*.The
 symbol for the indefinite integral is∫
*f(x)dx.*If*F(x)*isone
 antiderivative of *f*,the indefinite integral is the set of all functions of the form
*F(x)*+C0, C0constant.
Weexpress this with the equation
Itis an equation between two families of functions rather
 than betweentwo single functions. C is called the *constantof integration*.To illustrate
 the notation,
              ∫ 3*x²dx*=*x3*+*C*.
Werepeat the above definitions in concise form.
**DEFINITION**
*Letthe domain of f be an open interval I and suppose f has anantiderivative. The family of all antiderivatives of f is called the**indefinite integral **off and is denoted by* ∫
*f(x)dx.*
*Givena function f, the family of all functions which differ from F only bya constant is written F(x) +C. Thus if F is an antiderivative of f wewrite *
              ∫ *f(x)dx*=*F(x)*+*C*.
Whenworking with indefinite integrals, it is convenient to
 usedifferentials and dependent variables. If we introduce the dependentvariable *u*by*u*=*F*(*x*),then
*du =F'(x)dx = f(x)dx.*
Thusthe equation
   ∫ *f(x)dx*=*F(x)*+*C*.
canbe written in the from  
   ∫ *du*=*u*+*C*.
Thedifferential symbol
*d*andthe indefinite integral symbol
∫behaveas inverses to each other. We can start with the family of functions*u*+*C*,form
*du*,and then form
∫*du=u+ C*toget back where we started. Some of the rules for differentiationgiven in Chapter 2 can be turned around to give a set of rules forindefinite integration.
**THEOREM2**
*Letu and v be functions of x whose domains are an open interval I andsuppose du and dv exist for every x in I.*
(i) ∫
*du*=*u*+C
(ii) Constant Rule
∫*cdu*=*c*∫*du.*
(iii) Sum Rule
∫*du + dv =*∫*du +*∫*dv.*
(iv) Power Rule 
∫*ur du =**__________**+C, where r is rational, r*≠－1,
and*u*>0
 on *I*
(V)   ∫sin*u du*=*－*cos*u +C*.
(vi)   ∫cos*u du*=*－*sin*u +C*.
(vii)  ∫
*eudu*=*eu**+ C*.
(viii)  _______________=1n|*u*|+*C (u*≠
 0).
***Discussion*****ThePower Ruler**givesthe integral of
*u*rwhen*r*≠－1,while
 Rule (viii) gives the integral of  *u*r when*r= *－1.When
 we put*u= f(x) andv=g(x), the Constant and Sum Rules take the form*
*ConstantRule*∫ *cf(x)dx*=*c*∫*f(x)d(x)*.
SumRule  
∫(*f(x)+g(x)*)*dx*=∫
*f(x)d(x)+*∫
*g(x)d(x)*.
Inthe Constant and Sum Rules we are multiplying a family of functionsby a constant and adding two families of functions. If we do
 eitherof these two things to families of functions differing only by aconstant, we get another family of functions differing only by aconstant. For example,
7(3x4+*C*)=21*x*4+
 7*C*=21*x*4+*C*'
isthe family of all functions equal to 21x4plusa
 constant. Similarly,
isthe family of all functions equal to 5x + 2_____ plus a constant.
PROOFOF THEOREM 2
(i) This is just a short form of the theorem that
*u*+*C*isthe
 family of all functions which have 
the samederivative
 as *u.*
(ii) We have
*cdu*=*d(cu)*,whence
               ∫ *cdu*=∫*d(cu)*=*cu+C*=*c(u+C')*=*c*∫*du.*
(iii)  *du + dv =d(u + v), *
∫*du*+dv
 = ∫*d(u+v)*=*u+v+C*=∫*du+*
∫*dv.*
(iv)  ___________________
Rules(v)-(viii)are similar. Only the last formula, (viii),
 requires an explanation.The absolute value in 1n |*u*|comesabout
 by combining the two cases *u*>0and 
*u*<0. When
*u *>0,
u=|*u*|and
When*u*<0, 1n
*u isundefined, but*|*u*|=－*uand *1n|*u*|=1n(－*u).Thus*
Thus,in both cases, when*u*≠0,
*d*(1n|*u*|=____*du*,
EXAMPLE1
∫ (2*x*-1+
 3sin *x *)*dx*=21n
 |*x*|-3
 cos *x*+*C.*
Wecan use the rules to write down at once the indefinite integral ofany polynomial.
EXAMPLE2  
∫(4*x*3-
 6*x*-²+2*x+*1)*dx*=*x*4-2*x*3+*x*²+*x+C.*
EXAMPLE3  
Indefiniteintegration is much harder than differentiation, because there are norules for integrating the product or quotient of
 two functions. Itoften requires guesswork. The short list of rules in Theorem 1 willhelp, and as this course proceeds we shall add many more techniquesfor finding indefinite integrals.
EXAMPLE4 Show that
Ourrules give no hint on finding this integral. However, once the answeris given to us we can easily prove that it is correct bydifferentiating,
Hereis warning that may prevent some common mistakes.
Warning:the integral of the product of two functions is not equal to theproduct of the integrals.

Theindefinite integral can be used to solve problems of the
 followingtype. Given that a particle moves along the *y*-axiswith velocity
*v=f(t)*,and that at a certain time*t*=*t*0itsposition
 is y=y0. Find the position *y*asa function of
*t*.
EXAMPLE5  A particle moves with velocity
*v*=1/*t*²,*t*>0.At time
*t*=2 it is at position
*y*=1.Find the position
*y*asa function of
*t*.We compute
Since*dy/dt*=*v, y*isone of the functions in the family -1
*/t*+C. We can find the constant
*C*bysetting
*t*=2and
*y*=1,
Thenthe answer is
Thenext theorem shows that in such a problem we can always find theanswer if we are given the position of the particle at just one
 pointof time.
**THEOREM3**
*Supposethe domain of f is an open interval I and f has an antiderivative.Let P(x0, y0) be any point with x0in1. Then f has exactly one antiderivative whose graph passes throughP.*
PROOF Let
*F*beany antiderivative of
*f*.Then
*F*(x)+
*C*isthe family of all antiderivatives. We show that
 there is exactly onevalue of *C*suchthat the function
*F(x)*+*C*passesthrough*P*(x*0*,y*0*)(Figure
 4.3.2). We note that all of the following statements areequivalent:
(1) *F*(*x*)+
*C*passesthrough
*P*(*x0*,*y0*).
(2) *F*(*x0*)+
*C = y0*.
(3) *C = y0**－**F*(*x0*).
Thusy*0*-F(x*0*)is
 the unique value of*C*whichworks.

TheFundamental Theorem of Calculus, part (ii), may be expressed
 brieflyas follows, where *f*iscontinuous on*I*.
*If*∫
*f(x)dx = F(x) +C, then*
_________*f(x)d(x)*=*F(b) - F(a)*.
Forevaluating definite integrals we introduce the convenient notation
Itis read
“*F(x)*evaluatedfrom
*a*to*b*.”

TheConstant Rule is shown by the computation
TheSum Rule is similar.

Thearea is exactly 2.

Figure4.3.5
Thisexample illustrates the need for the absolute value in theintegration rule
                   ∫ *x*-1*dx = *1n|*x*|*+ C.*
Thenatural logarithm 1n
*x* is undefined at *x *= －5and
*x*= －1,but 1n |
*x*| is defined for all   *x *≠0.The absolute value sign is put in when integrating*x*-1 and removed when differentiating 1n |
*x*|.
**EXAMPLE9**  In computing definite integrals one must first make surethat the function to be integrated is continuous
 on the interval. Forinstance,
Incorrect: 
Thisis clearly wrong because 1/x² >0 so the area under the curvecannot be negative. The mistake is that 1/*x*² is undefined
 at*x*=0 and hence the function is discontinuous at *x*=0.Therefore the area under the curve and the definite integral
areundefined (Figure 4.3.6).
