4.1 THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Weshall begin our study of the integral calculus in the same way inwhich we began with the differential calculus - by asking a questionabout
 curves in the plane.
Suppose*f*is a real function continuous on an interval *I *andconsider the curve 
*y=f(x). *Let *a<b *where *a,b*are two points in *I*, and let the curve be above the
*x*-axisfor *x *between *a* and *b*; that is, *f(x)*≥0. We then ask: What is meant by the area of the region bounded bythe curve
*y= f(x)*, the *x*-axis, and the lines *x=a*and *x=b*? That is, what is meant by the area of the shadedregion in Figure 4.1.1? We call this region the region under thecurve
*y=f(x)* between *a* and *b*.

Figure4.1.1  The Region under a Curve
Thesimplest possible case is where
*f* is a constant function; thatis, the curve is a horizontal line *f(x)=k*, where
*k* is aconstant and *k*≥ 0, shown in Figure 4.1.2. In this case theregion under the curve is just a rectangle with height
*k* andwidth *b- a*, so the area is defined as 
Area =*k. (b-a).*
Theareas of certain other simple regions, such as triangles, trapezoidsand semicircles, are given by formulas from plane geometry.

Figure4.1.2
Thearea under any continuous curve
*y=f(x)* will be given by thedefinite integral, which is written
Beforeplunging into the detailed definition of the integral, we outline themain ideas.
First,the region under the curve is divided into infinitely many verticalstrips of infinitesimal width
*dx*. Next, each vertical strip isreplaced by a vertical rectangle of height
*f(x)*, base *dx*,and area *f(x) dx*. The next step is to form the sum of theareas of all these rectangles, called the infinite Riemann sum (lookahead to Figures 4.1.3 and 4.1.11). Finally, the integral
∫ba *f(x)dx* is defined as the standard part of theinfinite Riemann sum.
Theinfinite Riemann sum, being a sum of rectangles, has an infinitesimalerror. This error is removed by taking the standard part
 to form theintegral.
Itis often difficult to compute an infinite Riemann sum, since it is asum of infinitely many infinitesimal rectangles. We shall first
 studyfinite Riemann sums, which can easily be computed on a handcalculator.
Supposewe slice the region under the curve between
*a* and *b*into thin vertical strips of equal width. If there are *n*slices, each slice will have width Δ*x=(b -a)/n*. The interval[ *a, b*] will be partitioned into *n* subintervals
where  
Thepoints 
*x*0,*x*1,……*x*n are called partitionpoints. On each subinterval [
*x*k-1,  *x*k], we formthe rectangle of height *f*( *x*k-1). The
*k*threctangle will have area
*f*(*x*k-1)·Δx
FromFigure 4.1.3, we can see that the sum of the areas of all theserectangles will be fairly close to the area under the curve. This
 sumis called a Riemann sum and is equal to 
*f*(*x*0) Δ*x* + 
*f*( *x*1)Δ*x +… f*(*x*n-1)Δ*x.*
Itis the area of the shaded region in the picture. A convenient way ofwriting Riemann sums is the “∑-notation” { ∑ is the capitalGreek
 letter sigma},

Figure4.1.3  the Riemann Sum
The*a* and
*b* indicate that the first subinterval begins at *a*and the last subinterval ends at
*b*. 
Wecan carry out the same process even when the subinterval length Δ*x*does not divide evenly into the interval length
*b-a*. But then,as Figure 4.1.4 shows, there will be a remainder left over at the endof the interval [*a,b*], and the Riemann sum will have an extrarectangle whose width is this remainder. We let
*n* be thelargest integer such that
*a+ n*Δ*x*≤
*b,*
andwe consider the subintervals
[*x*0,*x*1],…，[*x*n-1,*x*n],
 [*x*n, *b*],
wherethe partition points are
*x*0*=a,   x*1
*=a+*Δ*x, x*2
*=a+*2Δ*x,……**，**x*n*=a+n*Δ*x,b.*

Figure4.1.4
*xn* will be less than or equal to
*b* but *xn *+Δ*x* willbe greater than *b*. Then we define the Riemann sum to be thesum
____________________________
Thusgiven the function
*f*, the interval [*a,b*], and the realnumber Δ*x> *0, we have defined the Riemann sum
_____*f(x)* Δ*x.* We repeat the definition more concisely.
DEFINITION
Let *a<b* and let Δ*x* be positive real number. Then theRiemann sum
___ is defined as the sum
Where*n* is the largest integer such that
*a + n *Δ*x* ≤*b*, and
arethe partition points.
If*x*n=*b*, the last term f(*x*n) (b -*x*n) iszero. The Riemann sum___*f(x)*Δ*x*is
 a real function of three variables *a, b,* and Δ*x*,
Thesymbol
*x *which appears in the expression is called a dummyvariable (or bound variable), because the value of
______*f(x)*Δ*x*does not depend on
*x*. The dummy variable allows us to use morecompact notation,writing *f(x)*Δ*x*just once instead of writing
*f(x*0*)*Δ*x*,
*f(x1)*Δ*x,**f*(*x2*)Δ*x*,and
 so on.
FromFigure 4.1.5 it is plausible that by making
Δ*x*smaller we can get the Riemann sum as close to the area as we wish.

Figure4.1.5
EXAMPLE 1   Let
*f(x)*=___. InFigure 4.1.6, the region under the curve from
*x* = 0
to *x*=2 is a triangle with base 2 and height 1, so its area should be

Figure4.1.6
Let uscompare this value for the area with some Riemann sums. In figure4.1.7, we take
Δ*x*=_____. The interval [0, 2] divides intofour subintervals
________, ___and
____. We make a table ofvalues of *f(x)* at the lower endpoints.

Figure4.1.7
The Riemannsum is then
InFigure 4.1.8, we take 
Δ*x*=_____. The table of valuesis as follows.
TheRiemann sum is
Wesee that the value is getting closer to one.
Finally,let us take a value of
Δ*x*that does not divide evenly into the interval length 2. Let
Δ*x*. We see in Figure 4.1.9 that the interval then divides into threesubintervals of length 0.6 and
 one of length 0.2, namely [0, 0.6],[0.6, 1.2], [1.2, 1.8], [1.8, 2.0],

Figure4.1.8
TheRiemann sum is
Example2  Let
*f(x)* =_______,defined on the closed interval
*I*=[-1,1]. The region under thecurve is a semicircle of radius 1. We know from plane geometry thatthe area is π/2, or approximately 3.14/2=1.57. Let us compute thevalues of some Riemann sums for this function to see how close theyare to 1.57. First
 take Δ*x=**____*as in
 Figure 4.1.10(a). We make a table of values.
TheRiemann sum is then
Nextwe take
Δ*x=*____.Then the interval [-1, 1] is divided into ten subintervals
 as inFigure 4.1.10 (b). Our table of values is as follows.
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/99/ce9964d0624a80cbeee0f99a0a7ecdb2.files/file0010.png)![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/99/ce9964d0624a80cbeee0f99a0a7ecdb2.files/file0011.png)
Figure4.1.10
TheRiemann sum is
Thuswe are getting closer to the actual area π/2 ~ 1.57.
Bytaking 
Δ*x*small we can get the Riemann sum to be as close to the area as wewish.
Ournext step is to take
Δ*x*to be infinitely small and have an infinite Riemann sum. How can wedo this? We observe that if the
 real numbers *a *and *b*are held fixed, then the Riemann sum
isa real function of the single variable
Δ*x*.(The symbol
*x* which appears in the expression is a dummyvariable, and the value of 
dependsonly on
Δ*x*and not on
*x*.)  Furthermore, the term
isdefined for all real 
Δ*x*>0. Therefore by the Transfer Principle,
isdefined for all hyperreal
*dx*>0. When *dx*>0 isinfinitesimal, there are infinitely many subintervals of length
*dx*,and we call
aninfinite Riemann sum(Figure 4.1.11).

Figure4.1.11 Infinite Riemann Sum
Wemay think intuitively of the Riemann sum
asthe infinite sum
where*H* is the greatest hyperinteger such that
*a* +*H dx*≤b, (Hyperintegers are discussed in Section 3.8.) *H *
is positiveinfinite, and there are *H* +2 partition points *x*0,*x*1,…，xH,*b*.
 A typical term in this sum is the infinitely small quantity*f*(*x*K)
*dx* where *K *is hyperinteger, 0 ≤*K*<*H *, and *x*K = *a* + *K dx*.
Theinfinite Riemann sum is a hyperreal number. We would next like totake the standard part of it. But first we must show that it
 is afinite hyperreal number and thus has a standard part.
THEOREM1
*Letf be a continuous function on an interval I, let a<b be two pointsin I, and let dx be a positive infinitesimal. Then the infiniteRiemann sum*
isa finite hyperreal number.
PROOF Let B be a real number greater than the maximum value of
*f *on[*a,b*].
Consider firsta real number
Δ*x*>0. We can see from figure 4.1.12 that the

Figure4.1.12
Finite Riemannsum is less than the rectangular area
*B.(b-a)*;
Thereforeby the Transfer Principle,
Ina similar way we let
*C* be less than the minimum of *f *on[*a, b*] and show that
Thusthe Riemann sum
________*f(x)dx* isfinite.
Weare now ready to define the central concept of this chapter, thedefinite integral. Recall that the derivative was defined as thestandard
 part of the quotient Δ*y/*Δ*x*and
 was written *dy/dx*. The “definite integral”will be defined as the standard part of the infinite Riemann sum
andis written
___*f(x) dx*. Thus theΔ*x*is changed to
*dx* in analogy with our differential notation.The 
___ is changed to the long thin *S*,i.e., ∫, to remind us that the integral is obtained from aninfinite sum. We now state the definition carefully.
DEFINITION
*Letf be a continuous function on an interval I and let a <b be twopoints in I.*
*Let dxbe a positive infinitesimal. Then the definite integral offrom a to b with*
*respect todx is defined to be the standard part of the infinite Riemann sumwith*
*respect todx, in symbols*

We alsodefine
Bythis definition, for each positive infinitesimal
*dx* thedefinite integral
isa real function of two variables defined for all pairs(*u,w*) ofelements of
*I*. The symbol *x* is a dummy variable sincethe value of 
doesnot depend on
*x*.
Inthe notation
___ *f(x) dx* for theRiemann sum and ___*f(x) dx* forthe integral, we always use matching symbols for the infinitesimal
*dx*and the dummy variable *x*. Thus when there are two or morevariables we can tell which one is the dummy variable in an integral.For example,
*x²t *can be integrated from 0 to 1 with respectto either *x* or *t*. With respect to *x*,
(where*dx*=1/*H*), and we shall see later that
Withrespect to
*t*, however,
andwe shall see later that
Thenext two examples evaluate the simplest definite integrals. Theseexamples do it the hard way. A much better method will be developedin
 Section 4.2.
EXAMPLE3  Given a constant
*C *>0, evaluate the integral ___*c dx*.
Figure 4.1.13shows that for every positive real number
Δ*x*,the finite Riemann
sum is
By theTransfer Principle, the infinite Riemann sum in Figure 4.1.14 has thesame value,
Taking standardparts,
This isthe familiar formula for the area of a rectangle.

EXAMPLE4  Given
*b*> 0, evaluate the integral____*xdx*.
The areaunder the line
*y=x* is divided into vertical strips of width*dx.*
Study Figure4.1.15. The area of the lower region
*A *is the infinite Riemann
Sum
*(1)*                           area of
*A* = ____*xdx.*
By symmetry,the upper region B has the same area as A;
(2)                            area of
*A* = area of *B*.                        
Call theremaining region C, formed by the infinitesimal squares along thediagonal. Thus
(3)areof 
*A* + area of  *B* + area of  *C*=*b².*
Each squarein C has height
*dx* except the last one, which may be smaller,and the widths add up to *b*, so

4.2 FUNDAMENTAL  THEOREM  OF  CALCULUS
Inthis section we shall state five basic theorems about the integral,culminating in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Right now
 we canonly approximate a definite integral by the laborious computation ofa finite Riemann sum. At the end of this section we will be in aposition easily to compute exact values for many definite integrals.The key to the method is the Fundamental Theorem.
 Our first theoremshows that we are free to choose any positive infinitesimal we wishfor
*dx* in the definite integral.
THEOREM1
*Givena continuous function f on [a, b] and two positive infinitesimals dxand du, the definite integrals with respect to dx and du are thesame,*
