4.2 FUNDAMENTAL  THEOREM  OF  CALCULUS
In this section we shall state five basic theorems about the integral,culminating in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Right now
 we can only approximate a definite integral by the laborious computation ofa finite Riemann sum. At the end of this section we will be in aposition easily to compute exact values for many definite integrals.The key to the method is the Fundamental Theorem.
 Our first theoremshows that we are free to choose any positive infinitesimal we wishfor*dx* in the definite integral.
THEOREM1
*Givena continuous function f on [a, b] and two positive infinitesimals dxand du, the definite integrals with respect to dx and du are thesame,*
Fromnow on when we write a definite integral_____*f(x)dx*,it is understood that*dx*
 is a positive infinitesimal. Bytheorem 1, it doesn’t matter which infinitesimal.
Theproof of Theorem 1 is based on the following intuitive idea. Figure4.2.1 shows the two Riemann sums_____*f(x)dx*and___*f(u) du*. We see from thefigure that the difference______*f(x)dx* -_____*f(u) du* is asum of rectangles of infinitesimal height. These differencerectangles all lie between the
 horizontal lines*y= -ε* and*y=ε*, where*ε* is the largest height. Thus -*ε(b-a)*____ _____*f(x) dx*-____*f(u)du*≤*ε (b -a)*. Taking standard
 parts,

Figure4.2.1
Theorem1 shows that whenever Δx is positive infinitesimal, the Riemann sumis infinitely close to the definite integral,
Thisfact can also be expressed in terms of limits. It shows that theRiemann sum approaches the definite integral as Δx approaches

Givena continuous function*f*on an interval*I*, Theorem Ishows that the definite integral is a real function of two
 variables*a* and*b*,
Wenow formally define the area as the definite integral shown in Figure4.2.2.

Figure4.2.2
DEFINITION
*Iff is continuous and f(x)*≥0*on*[*a,b*]*,the area of the region below the curve y=f(x) from a to b is definedas the definite integral:*
Thenext two theorems give basic properties of the integral.
THEOREM2 (The Rectangle Property)
*Supposef is continuous and has minimum value m and maximum value M on aclosed interval [a, b]. Then*
*Thatis, the area of the region under the curve is between the area of therectangle whose height is the minimum value of and the area of therectangle whose height is the maximum value of in the interval [a,b].*
TheExtreme Value Theorem is needed to show that the minimum value*m*and maximum value*M* exist.
 The rectangle of height *m* iscalled the*inscribed rectangle* of the region, and therectangle of height*M* is called the*circumscribedrectangle*. From Figure 4.2.3, we see that the inscribed rectangleis a subset of the region under
 the curve, which is in turn a subsetof the circumscribed rectangle. The Rectangle Property says that thearea of the region is between the areas of the inscribed andcircumscribed rectangles.

Figure4.2.3 the Rectangle Property
PROOF  By Theorem 1, any positive infinitesimal may be chosen for*dx*.Let us choose a positive infinite hyperinteger*H*
 and let*dx*=(*b-a*) /*H*. Then*dx* evenly divides*b-a*;that is, the interval [*a, b*] is divided into*H*subintervals of exactly the same length*dx*. Then
Foreach*x*, we have*m*≤*f(x)*≤*M*. Adding upand taking standard parts, we obtain the required formula.
Oneuseful consequence of the Rectangle Property is that the integral ofa positive function is positive and the integral of a negativefunction
 is negative:
Thedefinite integral of a negative function*f(x)*= -*g(x)*from*a* to*b* is just the negative of the area
 of theregion above the curve and below the*x* axis.
Thisis because 
*f(x)dx = -g(x)dx,*
(SeeFigure 4.2.4.)

Figure4.2.4
THEOREM3 (The Addition Property)
*Supposef is continuous on an interval I. Then for all a, b, c in I,*
Thisproperty is illustrated in Figure 4.2.5 for the case*a<b<c.*The Addition Property holds even if the points*a, b,c*
 are insome other order on the real line, such as*c<a<b.*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/7b/4c7b52b39073e83d5a4ef6b1e6482ab7.files/file0021.png)

Figure4.2.5
PROOF  First suppose that*a<b<c*. Choose a*dx* that evenlydivides the first interval length*b -a*. This simplifies
 ourcomputation because it makes*b* a partition point,*b=a+H dx*.Then, as Figure 4.2.6 suggests,
Takingstandard parts we have the desired formula
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/7b/4c7b52b39073e83d5a4ef6b1e6482ab7.files/file0022.png)

Figure4.2.6
To illustratethe other cases, we prove the Addition Property when
*c<a<b.*The previous case gives
Sincereversing the endpoints changes the sign of the integral,
andthe desired formula
follows.
Thedefinite integral of a curve can be thought of as area even if thecurve crosses the x-axis. The curve in Figure
 4.2.7 is positive from*a* to *b* and negative from *b* to *c*, crossingthe *x*-axis at *b.* The integral 
___*f(x) dx* is a positive number and the integral 
___*f(x) dx* is a negative number. By the Addition Property, theintegral
isequal to the area from*a* to*b* minus the area from*b*to*c*. The definite integral___*f(x) dx* always gives the net area between the*x*-axisand the curve, counting areas above the*x*-axis as positive andareas below the*x*-axis as negative.
Thedefinite integral__*f(t)dt* is areal function of two variables*u*
 and *v* and does notdepend on the dummy variable*t.* If we replace*u*by aconstant*a* and*v* by the variable*x*, we obtain areal function of one variable*x*, given by
Ourfourth theorem states that this new function is continuous.

Figure4.2.7
THEOREM4
*Letf be continuous on an interval 1. Choose a point a in 1. Then thefunction F(x) defined by*
*iscontinuous on 1.*
SKETCHOF PROOF   Let*c*be in*1*, and let*x* beinfinitely close to*c* and between the end points of*1*.By
 the Addition Property.
and
Thisis the area of the infinitely thin strip under the curve*y=f(t)*between*t=x* and*t=c* (see Figure 4.2.8).
 The strip haswidth Δx=c -x. By the Rectangle Property, its area is between*m* Δx and*M*Δx and hence is infinitely small. Therefore*F(x)*is infinitely close to*F(c)*, and*F* is continuous on*1*.

Figure4.2.8
Ourfifth theorem, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, shows that thedefinite integral can be evaluated by means of antiderivatives.
 Theprocess of antidifferentiation is just the opposite ofdifferentiation. To keep things simple, let*I* be an openinterval, and assume that all functions mentioned have domain*I*.
DEFINITION
*Letf and F be functions with domain I. If f is the derivative of F, thenF is called an antiderivative of f.*
Forexample, suppose a particle is moving upward along the*y*-axiswith velocity*v=f(t)*and position*y=F(t)* at
 time*t*.The position *y=F(t)* is an antiderivative of the velocity*v=f(t)*. We shall discuss antiderivatives in more detail in thenext section. We are now ready for the Fundamental Theorem.
FUNDAMENTALTHEOREM OF CALCULUS
*Supposef is continuous on its domain, which is an open interval I.*
(i )*For each point a in I, the definite integral of f from a to xconsidered as a function of x is an antiderivative of f. That is,*
(ii)*If F is any antiderivative of f, then for any two points (a, b) inI the definite integral of f from a to b is equal to the differenceF(b) - F(a),*
TheFundamental Theorem of Calculus is important for two reasons. First,it shows the relation between the two main notions of Calculus:
 thederivative, which corresponds to velocity, and the integral, whichcorresponds to area. It shows that differentiation and integrationare “inverse” processes. Second, it gives a simple method forcomputing many definite integrals.
EXAMPLE1
(a) Find____*cdx*. Since*cx* is anantiderivative of*c*,
(b) Find___*xdx*.__x²is an antiderivative of*x*.
 Thus
Theabove example gives the same result that we got before but is muchsimpler. We can easily go further.
EXAMPLE2  Find___*x² dx*.*x*3/3 is an antiderivative of*x*² because
Therefore   
Thisgives the area of the region under the curve*y=x²* between*a*and*b*
(Figure4.2.9).

Figure4.2.9
Ifa particle moves along the*y*-axis with continuous velocity*v=f(t)*, the position*y=F(t)* is an antiderivative
 of thevelocity, because*v=dy/dt.* The Fundamental Theorem of Calculusshows that the distance moved (the change in*y*) between times*t=a*and*t=b* is equal to the definite integral of thevelocity,
EXAMPLE3  A particle moves along the*y*-axis with velocity*v=8t3*cm/sec. How far does it move between times*t= -1*and*t= 2*sec? The function*G(t)=2t4* is an antiderivative of thevelocity*v = 8t3*. Thus the definite integral is
EXAMPLE4  Find____*dt*(Figure4.2.10). The function___is
 defined andcontinuous on the half-open interval [0,∝). But to apply theFundamental Theorem we need a function continuous on an open intervalthat contains the limit points 0 and 4. We therefore define
Thisfunction is continuous on the whole real line. In particular it iscontinuous at 0 because if t≈ 0 then*f(t)* ≈ 0. Thefunction

Figure4.2.10
is anantiderivative of*f*.Then
Inthe next section we shall develop some methods for findingantiderivatives. The antiderivative of a very simple function mayturn
 out to be a “new”function which we have not yetgiven a name.
EXAMPLE5   The only way we can show that the function
*f(x)*=
________has an antiderivative is to take adefinite integral
Thisis a
“new”function that cannot be expressedin terms of algebraic, trigonometric, and exponential functionswithout calculus.
TheFundamental Theorem cal also be used to find the derivative of afunction which is defined as a definite integral with a variablelimit of integration.. This
 can be done without actually evaluatingthe integral.

Bythe Chain Rule,
Weconclude this section with a proof of the Fundamental Theorem ofCalculus.
PROOF(i) Let
*F(x)*be the area under the curve
*y=f(t)*from
*a*to
*x*,
Imaginethat the vertical line cutting the
*t*-axisat*x*
movesto the right as in Figure 4.2.11
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/0a/1a0a93d41deed5060f2ca56e96b0abdb.files/file0027.png)
Figure4.2.11
Weshow that the rate of change of F(*x*)is
 equal to the length *f(x)*of the moving vertical line.
Suppose*x*increasesby an infinitesimal amount Δx> 0. Then 
isthe area of an infinitely thin strip of width Δx and heightinfinitely close to*f(x)*.By the Rectangle Property the area of the strip is between theinscribed and circumscribed rectangles (Figure 4.2.12),
*m*Δ*x*≤*F*(x+Δ*x*)-
*F*(*x*)≤*M*Δ*x.*
DividingbyΔ*x,     m*≤_________ ≤
*M*.
Since*f*iscontinuous at
*x*,the values
*m*and*M*areboth
 infinitely close to *f(x)*,
andtherefore
Theproof is similar when Δx<0. Hence
*F*'(*x*)=*f(x).*

PROOF(ii)  Let*F(x)*beany antiderivative of
*f*.Then, by(i),
InSection 3.7 on curve sketching, we saw that every function withderivative zero is constant. Thus
