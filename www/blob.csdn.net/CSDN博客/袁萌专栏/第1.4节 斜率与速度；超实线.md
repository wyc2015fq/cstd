1.4 SLOPE AND VELOCITY;  THE  HYPERREAL  LINE
In Section 1.3 the slope of the line through
 the points (*x*1,*y*1) and (*x*2,*y*2)
 is shown to be the ratio of the change in *y *to the change in
*x*,

If the line has the equation
*y = mx + b,*
Then the constant*m*is
 the slope.
What is meant by the slope of a curve? The differential calculus is needed to answer this question, as well
 as to provide a method of computingthe value of the slope. We shall do this in the next chapter.However, to provide motivation, we now describe intuitively themethod of finding the slope.
Considerthe parabola               
*y=x*².
Theslope will measure the direction of a curve just as it measures
 thedirection of a line. The slope of this curve will be different atdifferent points on the*x*-axis,because the direction of the curve changes.
If(*x*0,*y*0)and
 (*x*0+Δ*x*,*y*0+Δ*y*)are
 two points on the curve, then the “averageslope”ofthe
 curve between these two points is defined as the ratio of thechange in*y*tothe change in*x*,
averageslope
 = ____.
Thisis exactly the same as the slope of the straight line through
 thepoints (*x*0,*y*0)and
(*x*0+Δ*x*,*y*0+Δ*y*),as
 shown in Figure 1.4.1.

Figure1.4.1
Letus compute the average slope. The two points (*x*0,*y*0)and
 (*x*0+Δ*x*,*y*0+Δ*y*)are
 on the curve, so  
____________,
*y*0+Δ*y*=(*x*0+Δ*x*)²
Subtracting,           Δ*y*=(*x*0+Δ*x*)²-____
Dividingby Δx,          ______________
This can be simplified,

Thusthe average slope is

Noticethat this computation can only be carried out when Δ*x*≠0,because
 at Δ*x*=0the quotient Δy/Δ*x*isundefined.
Reasoningin a nonrigorous way, the actual slope of the curve at the point (*x*0,*y*0)can
 be found thus. Let *x *bevery small (but not zero). Then the point (*x*0+*x*,*y*0*+y*)is
 close to (*x*0,*y*0),so the average slope between these two points is close to the
 slopeof the curve at (*x*0,*y*0);
[slope at(*x*0,*y*0)]is
 close to 2*x*0+Δ*x.*
Weneglect the term Δ*x*becauseit
 is very small, and we are left with
[slopeat
 (*x*0,*y*0)]=2*x*0.
Forexample, at the point (0,0) the slope is zero, at the point (1,1) theslope is 2, and at the point (-3,9)
 the slope is -6.(see figure1.4.2.)
![](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20130723220036500?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQveXVhbm1lbmcwMDE=/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/SouthEast)
Figure1.4.2
Thewhole process can also be visualized in another way. Let*t*representtime,
 and suppose a particle is moving along the*y*-axisaccording to the equation*y*=*t*².That
 is, at each time*t*theparticle is at the point*t*²onthe*y*-axis.We
 then ask : what is meant by the*velocity*ofthe particle at time*t*0?Again
 we have the difficulty that the velocity is different atdifferent times, and the calculus is needed to answer the question ina satisfactory way. Let us consider what happens to the particlebetween a time*t*0anda
 later time*t*0+Δ*t*.The
 time elapsed is Δ*t*,and the distance moved is Δ*y*=2*t*0Δ*t*+(Δ*t*)².If
 the velocity were constant during the entire interval of time,then it would just be the ratio Δ*y/t*.However, the velocity is changing during the time interval. We shallcall
 the radio Δ*y/t *ofthe distance moved to the time elapsed the“averagevelocity”forthe
 interval;
![](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20130723220128546?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQveXVhbm1lbmcwMDE=/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/SouthEast)
Theaverage velocity is not the same as the velocity at time*t*0whichwe
 are after. As a matter of fact, for*t*0>0,the particle is speeding up; the velocity at time*t*0willbe
 somewhat less than the average velocity for the interval of timebetween *t*0and*t*0+*t*,and
 the velocity at time *t*0+*t*willbe somewhat greater than the average.
Butfor a very small increment of time Δ*t*,the
 velocity will change very little, and the average velocity Δ*y*/Δ*t*willbe
 close to the velocity at time *t*0.To get the velocity*v*0attime*t*0,we
 neglect the small term Δ*t*inthe formula
*V*ave=2*t*0+Δ*t*,
andwe are left with the value
*V*0=2*t*0.
Whenwe plot*y*against*t*,the
 velocity is the same as the slope of the curve*y*=*t²*,and the average velocity is
 the same as the average slope.
Thetrouble with the above intuitive argument, whether stated in
 terms ofslope or velocity, is that it is not clear when something is to be“neglected.”nevertheless,the
 basic idea can be made into a useful and mathematically soundmethod of finding the slope of a curve or the velocity. What isneeded is a sharp distinction between numbers which are small enoughto be neglected and numbers which aren’t.Actually,
 no real number except zero is small enough to be neglected.To get around this difficulty, we take the bold step of introducing anew kind of number, which is infinitely small and yet not equal tozero.
Anumber*ε*issaid
 to be infinitely small, or infinitesimal, if
*-a< ε < a*
for every positive real number*a*.Then
 the only real number that is infinitesimal is zero. We shall usea new number system called the*hyperreal numbers*,which contains all the real numbers and also has infinitesimals
 thatare not zero. Just as the real numbers can be constructed from therational numbers, the hyperreal numbers can be constructed from thereal numbers. This construction is sketched in the Epilogue at theend of the book. In this chapter, we shall simply list
 the propertiesof the hyperreal numbers needed for the calculus.
Firstwe shall give an intuitive picture of the hyperreal numbers
 and showhow they can be used to find the slope of a curve. The set of allhyperreal numbers is denoted by*R**.Every real number is a member of*R**,but*R**has
 other elements too. The infinitesimal in*R**are of three kinds: positive, negative, and the real number 0. Thesymbols Δ*x,*Δ*y*,…andthe
 Greek letters*ε*(epsilon)and*δ*(delta)will
 be used for infinitesimals. If*a*and*b*arehyperreal
 numbers whose difference*a -b*isinfinitesimal, we say that*a*isinfinitely
 close to*b*.For example, if Δ*x*isinfinitesimal
 the*x*0+*x*isinfinitely close to*x*0.If*ε*ispositive
 infinitesimal, then -*ε*willbe a negative infinitesimal. 1/*ε*willbe
 an*infinite positive number,*thatis, it will be greater than any real number. On the other hand, -1/*ε*willbe
 an *infinite negative number*,i.e., a number less than every real number. Hyperreal numbers whichare not infinite numbers are called*finite numbers.*Figure1.4.3
 shows a drawing of the hyperreal line. The circles represent“infinitesimalmicroscopes”whichare
 powerful enough to show an infinitely small portion of thehyperreal line. The set*R*ofreal numbers is scattered among the finite
 numbers. About each realnumber*c*isa portion of the hyperreal line composed of the numbers infinitelyclose to*c*(shownunder
 an infinitesimal microscope for*c*=0and*c*=100).The numbers infinitely close to 0
 are the infinitesimals.
InFigure 1.4.3 the finite and infinite parts of the hyperreal line
 wereseparated from each other by a dotted line. Another way to representthe infinite parts of the hyperreal line is with an“infinitetelescope”asin
 Figure 1.4.4. The field of view of an infinite telescope has thesame scale as the finite portion of the hyperreal line, while thefield of view of an infinitesimal microscope contains an infinitelysmall portion of the hyperreal line blown up.

We haveno way of knowing what a line in physical space is really like.
 Itmight be like the hyperreal line, the real line, or neither. However,in applications of the calculus it is helpful to imagine a line inphysical space as a hyperreal line. The hyperreal line is, like thereal line, a useful mathematical model for a line in
 physical space.
Thehyperreal numbers can be algebraically manipulated just like
 the realnumbers. Let us try to use them to find slopes of curves. We beginwith the parabola*y=x*².
Considera real point (*x*0,*y*0)on
 the curve *y=x*².Let Δ*x*beeither a positive
 or a negative infinitesimal (but not zero), and letΔ*y*bethe corresponding change in*y*.
Thenthe slope at (*x*0,*y*0)isdefined
 in the following way:
[ slopeat
 (*x*0,*y*0)] = [the real number infinitely close to___].
We compute__asbefore
 :  ![](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20130723220403531?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQveXVhbm1lbmcwMDE=/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/SouthEast)
Thisis hyperreal number, not a real number. Since Δ*x*isinfinitesimal,
 the hyperreal number 
2*x*0+*x*isinfinitely
 close to the real number 2*x*0.We conclude that
[ slopeat
 (*x*0,*y*0)]
 = 2*x*0.

Figure1.4.7
Theprocess can be illustrated by the picture in Figure 1.4.5, with
 theinfinitesimal changes Δ*x*andΔ*y*shownunder
 a microscope.
Thesame method can be applied to other curves. The third degree
 curve*y=x*3is shown in Figure 1.4.6. Let(*x*0,*y*0)be
 any point on the curve *y=x*3,and let Δ*x*bea
 positive or a negative infinitesimal. Let Δ*y*bethe corresponding change in y along the curve. In figure 1.4.7, Δ*x*andΔ*y*areshown
 under a microscope. We again define the slope at (*x*0,*y*0)by
[slope at(*x*0,*y*0)]=
 [ the real number infinitely close to_____].
We now compute the hyperreal number_____.

Inthe next section we shall develop some rules about infinitesimalwhich
 sill enable us to show that since Δ*x*isinfinitesimal,
3*x*0Δ*x+*(Δ*x*)²
isinfinitesimal as well. Therefore the hyperreal number

For example, at(0,0) the slope is zero, at (1,1) the slope is 3, and at(2,8) the slope is 12.
We shall return to the study of the slope of a curve in Chapter 2 afterwe have learned more about hyperreal
 numbers. Form the last exampleit is evident that we need to know how to show that two numbers areinfinitely close to each other. This is our next topic.
