6.6 **SOME APPLICATIONS  TO PHYSICS**
TheInfinite Sum Theorem can frequently be used to derive formulas inphysics.
1**MASS  AND DENSITY,  ONE DIMENSION**
Consider a one- dimensional object such as a length ofwire. We ignore the atomic nature of matter and assume that it isdistributed continuously along a line segment. If
 the density*ρ* per unit length is the same at each point of the wire,then the mass is the product of the density and the length,*m*= *ρL*. If*L* is incentimeters and
*ρ* in grams per centimeter, then*m* isgrams. (*ρ* is the Greek letter “rho”.)
Nowsuppose that the density of the wire varies continuously with theposition. Put the wire on the*x*-axis between the points*x*=*a* and*x=b*,
 and let the density at the pointx be*ρ(x).* Consider the piece of the wire of infinitesimallength Δ*x* and mass Δ*m* shown in Figure 6.6.1. At eachpoint between*x* and*x+*Δ*x*, the density isinfinitely close to *ρ(x),so*
Δ*m*
 ≈ *ρ(x)*Δ*x   (compared to*Δ*x).*

Figure 6.6.1
Therefore by the Infinite SunTheorem, the total mass is
*m*=_________*ρ(x)dx.*
**EXAMPLE 1**
Find the mass of a wire
 6 cmlong whose density at distance*x*from thecenter is 9 -*x*²gm/cm. InFigure 6.6.2, we put the
 center of the wire at the origin.Then
*m*=___9-*x*²*dx*=9*x*-____*x*3]______=
 36gm.

Figure6.6.2
**2  MASS  AND  DENSITY,TWO  DIMENSIONS**
Imagine a flat plate which occupies the regionbelow the curve*y= f(x), f(x)*≥0,from*x=a*to*x=b*.
If itsdensity per unit area is a constant*ρ*gm/cm², then its mass is the product of thedensity and area.
*m=ρ A=ρ**_____**_f(x)dx.*
Suppose instead that the density depends onthe value of*x*,*ρ(x).*Consider
 avertical strip of the plate of infinitesimal widthΔ*x*(Figure6.6.3). On the strip between*x*and*x+*Δ*x,*the
 densityis everywhere infinitely close to*ρ(x),*so
Δ*m*≈*ρ (x)*Δ*A*≈*ρ(x)f(x)*Δ*x.  (compared to*Δ*x).*

Figure6.6.3
By the Infinite SumTheorem,
*m*=_____*ρ(x)f(x)dx.*
**EXAMPLE 2 **
**A circular disc ofradius*****r*****hasdensity at each point equal to the distance of the point fromthe*****y*****-axis.Find its mass. ( the center of the circle, shown in Figure 6.6.4,is at the origin.) the circle is the region between thecurves****__________****from*****-r*****to*****r*****. The density at a point(*****x,y*****) in thedisc is |*****x*****|. Bysymmetry, all four quadrants have the same mass. We shall find themass m1****of thefirst quadrant and multiply byfour.**
Put*u= r*²-*x*²,*du = -2x dx;u*=*r*²when*x*=0,and*u*=0when*x=r.*
Then*m*=4*m*1=___*r*3.

Figure6.6.4
3 **MOMENTS, ONE DIMENSION**
Two children on a weightless seesaw willbalance perfectly if the product of their masses and theirdistances
 from the fulcrum are equal,*m*1*d*1=*m*2*d*2(Figure6.6.5)
![](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20130723212525750?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQveXVhbm1lbmcwMDE=/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/SouthEast)
Forexample, a 60 1b child 6 feet from the fulcrum will balance a 40 1bchild 9 feet from the fulcrum, 60·6=40·9. If the fulcrum is at theorigin*x*=0, the masses*m*1
 and*m*2 have coordinates*x*1 = -d and*x*2
 =*d*2. The equation for balancingbecomes
*m*1*x*1 +*m*2*x*2
 =0
Similarly, finitely many masses*m*1,…*m*k atthe points*x*1 …，*x*k
 will balance about thepoint*x*=0 if
*m*1*x*1 + …+*m*k*x*k
 = 0.
Givena mass*m* at the point*x*, the quantity
*mx* iscalled the moment about the origin.
Themoment of a finite collection of point masses*m*1,…*m*kat*x*1…*x*k about the origin is defined as thesum
*M*
 =*m*1*x*1 + …*m*k *x*k.
Suppose the point masses are rigidly connected to a rodof mass zero. If the moment*M* is equal to zero, the masseswill balance at the origin. In general they will
 balance at a point______ called the center of gravity(Figure 6.6.6) ._____ is equal to themoment divided by the total mass*m*.
Sincethe mass*m* is positive, the moment*M* has the samesign as the center of gravity___.
![](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20130723212727328?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQveXVhbm1lbmcwMDE=/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/SouthEast)
Figure6.6.6
Nowconsider a length of wire between *x*=*a* and*x= b* whose density at
*x* is *ρ(x)*.The moment of the wire about the origin is defined as theintegral
*M*
 = ____*x*ρ *(x)dx.*
This formula is justified by considering apiece of the wire of infinitesimal lengthΔ*x*.
 On thepiece from*x*to*x*+Δ*x*the
 densityremains infinitely close to*ρ*(*x*). Thus ifΔ*M*is
 themoment of the piece,
Δ*M*≈*x*Δ*m*≈*xρ*(*x*)Δ*x      (compared to*Δ*x*).
The moment of an object is equal tothe sum of the moments of its parts. Hence by the Infinite SumTheorem,
*M*=________*x*ρ(*x*)*dx.*
If the wire has moment*M*about
 the origin and mass*m*, the center of mass of the wire is defined asthe point
A point of mass*m*located
 at___has thesame moment about the origin as the whole wire,*M*=__*m*.Physically,
 the wire will balance on a fulcrum placed at the centerof mass.
**EXAMPLE 3**A
 wirebetween*x*=0and*x*=1 hasdensity*ρ (x) = x*²(Figure6.6.7).
 The moment is

A mass m at the point(*x*0*, y*0) in the(*x, y*) planewill have moments*M*xabout

*M*x=*my*0,  *M*y=*mx*0.

The Infinite Sum Theorem gives themoments for the whole wire,
We next take up the case of a flat plate whichoccupies the region*R*under
 thecurve*y= f(x), f(x)*≥0,from*x=a*to*x=b*(Figure6.6.10).
 Assume the density

*ρ(x)*dependsonly on the*x*-coordinate.
 A vertical slice of infinitesimalwidth Δ*x*between*x*and*x+*Δ*x*is
 almost avertical length of wire between 0 and*f(x)*which has areaΔ*A*andmass
Δ*m*≈*ρ(x)*Δ*A*≈*ρ(x)f(x)*Δ*x*(comparedto
 Δ*x*). Puttingthe mass Δ*m*into thevertical wire formulas, the momentsare
Δ*M*y≈*x*Δ*m*≈*xρ(x) f(x)*Δ*x *(compared
 to Δ*x*),
Δ*M*x≈_____(*f(x*)+0)Δ*m*≈___*ρ(x) f(x)²*Δ*x*(compared
 to Δ*x*),
Then by the Infinite Sum Theorem,the total moments are
The center of mass of a two-dimensional objectis defined as the point (____)
 withcoordinates
A single mass*m*at
 the point____will havethe same moments as the two- dimensionalbody,
*Mx*=*m*___,*My*=m__.
 Theobject will balance on a pin placed at the center ofmass.
If a two- dimensional object has constantdensity, the center of mass depends only on theregion*R*which
 itoccupies. The centroid of a region*R*is defined as the center of mass of an objectof constant density which occupies*R*.
 Thus if*R*is theregion below the continuous curve*y= f(x)*from*x= a*to*x=b*, then thecentroid has coordinates.

The following principle oftensimplifies a problem in moments.
If an object is symmetrical about anaxis, then its moment about that axis is zero and its center ofmass lies on the axis.
PROOF  Considerthe*y-*axis.Suppose
 a plane object occupies the region under thecurve*y=f(y)*from*-a*to*a*and
 itsdensity at a point (*x,y*)is*ρ (x)*(Figure6.6.12). The object is symmetric about
 the*y*-axis, so for all*x*between 0 and*a,*

5 WORK
A constant force*F*acting
 along a straight line for a distance srequires the amount of work
*W =F s.*
For example, the force of gravity on an objectof mass*m*near
 thesurface of the earth is very nearly a constant*g*times the mass,*F=gm*. Thus to
 lift an object of mass*m*a distance*s*againstgravity requires the work*W= gms*. Thefollowing principle is useful in computing work done againstgravity.
*Theamount of work done against gravity to move an object is the sameas it would be if all the mass were concentrated at the center ofmass. Moreover, the work against gravity depends only on thevertical change in position of the center of mass , not on theactual path of its motion.*
*That is, W= gms where s is the vertical change in thecenter of mass.*
**EXAMPLE 6**Asemicircular
 plate of radius one, constant density, andmass*m*lies flaton the table.(a) how much work is required to stand it up with thestraight edge horizontal on the table (Figure
 6.6.14(a)) ? (b) howmuch work is required to stand it up with the straight edgevertical and one corner on the table (Figure 6.6.14(b))? From theprevious exercise, we know thatthe

Figure6.6.14
Center of mass is on the central radius 4/3πfrom
 the center of the circle. Putthe*x*-axis onthe surface of the table.
(a)thecenter
 of mass is lifted a distance 4/3 πabove thetable. Therefore*W= mg*·4/(3π).
*(b)*Thecenter of mass is lifted a distance
 1 above the table,so*W=mg.*
Suppose a force*F(s)*varies
 continuously with theposition*s*and acts onan object to move it from*s = a*to*s =b*. The workis then the definite integral of the force with respectto*s,*
*W=**_____**F(s)ds.*
*Tojustify this formula we consider an infinitesimal length*Δ*s. On the interval from s tos +*Δ*s  theforce is infinitely close to F(s), so the work ΔW done on thisinterval satisfies*
Δ*W*≈*F(s)*Δ*s     (compared to*Δ*s).*
*Bythe Infinite Sum Theorem,*
