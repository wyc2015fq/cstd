CONTINUOUSFUNCTIONS
3.1 HOW TO SET UP A PROBLEM
In applications, a calculus problem is often presented verbally, and it is up to you to set up the problem in mathematical terms.
 The problem can usually be described mathematically by a list of equations and inequalities. The next two sections contain several examples that illustrate the process of setting up a problem. The examples in thissection are from algebra and geometry, and
 those in the next section are from calculus.
It is sometimes hard to see how to begin on a story problem. It is helpful to break the process up into three steps:
Step1  Draw a diagram if possible, and label all quantitiesinvolved.
Step2  Write the given information as a set of equations and/orinequalities.
Step3  Solve the mathematical problem, and interpret themathematical solution to answer the original story problem.
EXAMPLE1  According to a treasure map, a buried treasure is located dueeast of a cave
and is200 paces from a tree. The tree is 30 paces east and 40 paces northof the cave.
How faris the treasure from the cave?
The solutionof this problem uses the quadratic formula, which will be needed
throughout thecalculus course. We review it here.
*QUADRATIC FORMULA *If *a* ≠ 0 , then
*ax²+ bx +c =*0

We solveExample 1 in three steps.
Step1  Draw a diagram and label all quantities involved. In Figure3.1.1, we put the cave at
the originand let
*x* be the distance from the cave to the target alongthe *x*-axis. 
The treeis at the point (30, 40), and the treasure is at the point (*x*,0).

Theinequality
*x *≥ 0 arises because the treasure is east of thecave.
Step3  Solve for
*x*. We square the Distance Formula.

 we reject the negative solution. Thus
The treasureis approximately 226 paces from the cave.
Most calculusproblems involve two or more variables.

 can often be solved by implicit differentiation.

Thesing of
*dy/dt* is negative because *y* is decreasing.
Relatedrates problems have the following form.
*Given:*
(a)Twoquantities which depend on time, say
*x* and *y*.
*(b)*Therate of change of one of them,
 say *dx/dt.*
*(c)*Anequation showing the relationship
 between *x* and *y.*
(Usuallythis information is given in the form of a verbal description of aphysical situation and part of the problem is to express
 it in theform of an equation.)
*Theproblem: Find the rate of change of y, dy/dt, at a certain time t0. (the time t0 is sometimes specified by giving the value whichx, or y, has at that time.)*
Relatedrates problems can frequently be solved in four steps as we did inthe examples.
Step1   Label all quantities in the problem and draw a picture.If the labels are
*x, y,*
and *t*(time ). The remaining steps are as follows:
Step2  Write an equation for the given rate of change
*dx/dt.*Write another equation for the    
given relationbetween x and y.
Step3  Differentiate both sides of the equation relating
*x*and *y *with respect to *t*. 
We choosethe time
*t* as the independent variable. 
The resultis a new equation involving
*x, y, dx/dt, *and*dy/dt.*
Step4  
*Set t=t0 and solve for dy/dt. It may be necessary tofind the values of x, y, and dx/dt at t=t0 first.*

3.2 RELATED  RATES
In arelated rates problem, we are given the rate of change of onequantity and wish to find the rate of change of another. Suchproblems
 can often be solved by implicit differentiation.

Step1  Label all quantities involved and draw a diagram.

*Warning*: although the bottom end of the ladder is being moved at aconstant rate, the rate at which the top end moves will
 vary withtime.
Step1 
*t *=time,
*x=* distance of the bottom end from the wall,
*y*= height of the top end above the floor.
Thediagram is shown in Figure 3.2.2.

Thesing of
*dy/dt* is negative because *y* is decreasing.
Relatedrates problems have the following form.
*Given:*
(a)Twoquantities which depend on time, say
*x* and *y*.
*(b)*Therate of change of one of them,
 say *dx/dt.*
*(c)*Anequation showing the relationship
 between *x* and *y.*
(Usuallythis information is given in the form of a verbal description of aphysical situation and part of the problem is to express
 it in theform of an equation.)
*Theproblem: Find the rate of change of y, dy/dt, at a certain time t0. (the time t0 is sometimes specified by giving the value whichx, or y, has at that time.)*
Relatedrates problems can frequently be solved in four steps as we did inthe examples.
Step1   Label all quantities in the problem and draw a picture.If the labels are
*x, y,*
and *t*(time ). The remaining steps are as follows:
Step2  Write an equation for the given rate of change
*dx/dt.*Write another equation for the    
given relationbetween x and y.
Step3  Differentiate both sides of the equation relating
*x*and *y *with respect to *t*. 
We choosethe time
*t* as the independent variable. 
The resultis a new equation involving
*x, y, dx/dt, *and*dy/dt.*
Step4  
*Set t=t0 and solve for dy/dt. It may be necessary tofind the values of x, y, and dx/dt at t=t0 first.*
Thehardest step is usually step 2, because one has to start with thegiven verbal description of the problem and set up as a system
 offormulas. Sometimes more than two quantities that depend on time aregiven. Here is an example with three.
EXAMPLE3 
Onecar moves north at 40mph (miles per hour) and passes a point
*P*at time 1:00. Another car moves east at 60 mph and passes the samepoint
*P* at time 2:30. How fast is the distance between the twocars changing at the time 2:00?
Itit not even easy to tell whether the two cars are getting closer orfarther away at time 2:00. This is part of the problem.
Step1 
*t*= time,
*y*=position of the first car travelling north,
*x*=position of the second car travelling east,
*z*=distance between the two cars.

Wefirst find the values of

Thenegative sign shows that
*z* is decreasing. Therefore at 2:00the cars are getting closer to each other at the rate of 4 mph.
EXAMPLE 4 
Thepopulation of a country is growing at the rate of one million peopleper year, while gasoline consumption is decreasing by one
 billiongallons per year. Find the rate of change of the per capita gasolineconsumption when the population is 30 million and total gasolineconsumption is 15 billion gallons per year.
Bythe per capita gasoline consumption we mean the total consumptiondivided by the population.
Step1 
*t *= time
*x*= population
*y* =gasoline consumption
*z*= per capita gasoline consumption.

Theper capita gasoline consumption is decreasing at the annual rate of50 gallons per person.
Weconclude with another example from economics. In this example theindependent variable is the quantity
