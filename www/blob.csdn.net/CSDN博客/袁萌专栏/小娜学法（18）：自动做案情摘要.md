小娜学法（18）：自动做案情摘要
      小娜知道，1月25日，Microsoft’s smart digital assistant —Cortana — is getting a
[handful of new features](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/01/25/cortana-gets-better-at-helping-you-manage-your-busy-schedule/)from today, with those on the early-stage Windows Insider Program first to geta glimpse of the new tools.
      小娜提醒：我长了新本领，能够快速做文章摘要（需要自然语言理解能力），可以大大压缩档案的存储空间，一块固态硬盘能够代替档案存储大楼。
      小娜知道，Cortanapromises to get more intelligent over time, as it learns a user’s individualpreferences, and it has been offering a range of location-based reminders for awhile — so, for example, if you know you need to buy something for dinner,
 youcan be alerted when you walk past the supermarket. Now, Microsoft is takingthings a stage further by serving up reminders when you commit to do somethingin an email. It’s designed to help solve the perennial problem many face —overloaded inboxes and a tendency
 to “forget” promises made in email messages.
      The feature is the result of workcarried out with Microsoft Research (MSR), and it presumably uses naturallanguage processing (NLP) to identify things you say you’ll do and a time-framein which you commit to doing them. Cortana can then
 automatically remind you ofthis obligation through a pop-up message. So that pledge to your boss to getthe end-of-year report “done by EOD” will become harder to forget.
       小娜是我的小帮手，空闲时，小娜给我讲笑话，逗得我笑出了眼泪。
