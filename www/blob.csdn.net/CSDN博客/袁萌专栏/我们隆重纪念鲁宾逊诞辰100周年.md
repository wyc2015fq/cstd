        现今，纪念非标准分析（NSA）奠基人鲁宾逊（Abraham Robinson,1918.10.06 - 1974.08.11，享年56岁）诞辰100周年.具有重大现实意义。
        非标准分析（NSA）创立于1960年，是20世纪数学研究的重大进展之一。时至今日，非标准分析发展，方兴未艾，蒸蒸日上，未来前途不可限量。
        当今，非标准分析（也称为无穷小微积分）在中国发扬光大，进入全国高校校园课堂之中。对此情景，鲁宾逊的在天之灵，一定会含笑不止。
        为纪念鲁宾逊诞辰100周年，本文在附件“无穷小：历史与应用”中引用部分内容与读者分享。

Abstract（摘要全文）
​    ​    ​An inﬁnitesimal is a number whose magnitude exceeds zero but somehow fails to exceed any ﬁnite, positive number. Although logically problematic, inﬁnitesimals are extremely appealing for investigating continuous phenomena. They were used extensively by mathematicians until the late 19th century, at which point they were purged because they lacked a rigorous foundation. In 1960, the logician Abraham Robinson revived them by constructing a number system, the hyperreals, which contains inﬁnitesimals and inﬁnitely large quantities. This thesis introduces Nonstandard Analysis (NSA), the set of techniques which Robinson invented. It contains a rigorous development of the hyperreals and shows how they can be used to prove the fundamental theorems of real analysis in a direct, natural way. (Incredibly, a great deal of the presentation echoes the work of Leibniz, which was performed in the 17th century.) NSA has also extended mathematics in directions which exceed the scope of this thesis. These investigations may eventually result in fruitful discoveries（导致硕果累累的发现）.
