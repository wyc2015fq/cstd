**6.7 IMPROPER  INTEGRALS**
Whatis the area of the region under
 the curve *y*=1/______from*x*=0
 to *x*=1(Figure 6.7.1(a)) ? The function 1/_____isnot
 continuous at *x*=0, and in fact 1/_____isinfinite
 for infinitesimal ε>0.Thus our notion of a definite integral does
 not apply. Neverthelesswe shall be able to assign an area to the region using improperintegrals. We see from the figure that the region extends infinitelyfar up in the vertical direction. However, it becomes so thin thatthe area of the region turns out to
 be finite.

Figure6.7.1
extendsinfinitely far in the horizontal direction. We shall see that thisregion, too, has a finite area which is given by an improperintegral.
Improperintegrals are defined as follows.
**DEFINITION**
*Suppose fis continuous on the half - open interval [a, b]. The improperintegral of f from a to b is defined by the limit*
*Ifthe limit exists the improper integral is said to converge. Otherwisethe improper integral is said to diverge.*
Theimproper integral can also be described in terms of definiteintegrals with hyperreal endpoints. We first recall that the definiteintegral
isa real function of two variables
*u*and*v*.If
*u*and*v*varyover the hyperreal numbers instead of the real numbers, the definiteintegral
____*f(x)dx*standsfor the natural extension of
*D*evaluatedat (*u,v*),
Hereis description of the improper integral using definite integrals withhyperreal endpoints.
Let*f*becontinuous on (*a, b*].
(1)___ *f(x)dx*=*S**ifand only if __ f(x) dx *≈ *S for all positive infinite ε.*
(2)______*f(x) dx = *∝ *(or -*∝ *) if andonly if ___ f(x) d(x) is positive infinite (or negative infinite) forall*
*positive infiniteε.*
EXAMPLE1  Find
________.For*u*>0, 
Then 
Therefore theregion under the curve
*y*=1/____from 0 to 1 shown in Figure 6.7.1(a) has area 2,
and theimproper integral converges.
**EXAMPLE2**Find________*dx*.For
 u >0, 
Thistime
Theimproper integral diverges. Since the limit goes to infinity we maywrite
______*x*-2*dx*=∞
Theregion under the curve in Figure 6.7.2 is said to have
*infinitearea.*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/55/8155fa4dc44dacd04c1b976351926374.files/file0021.png)Warning:we
 remind the reader once again that the symbols ∞and-∞arenot real or even hyperreal numbers. We use
 them only to indicate thebehavior of a limit, or to indicate an interval without an upper orlower endpoint.
6.7.2
EXAMPLE3  Find the length of the curve
*y=x*2/3,0
≤ *x *≤8.From Figure 6.7.3 the curve must have finite length. However, thederivative
____________________
isundefined at*x*=0.Thus the length formula gives an improper integral,

![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/55/8155fa4dc44dacd04c1b976351926374.files/file0022.png)
**Figure6.7.3**
**Let*****u*****=9*****x*****2/3****+4, du = 6*****x*****-1/3*****dx*****.The indefinite integral is **
**Therefore**
**Noticethat we use the same symbol for both the definite and the improperintegral. The theorem below justifies this practice.**
**THEOREM1**
**Iff is continuous on the closed interval [a,b] then the improperintegral of f from a to b converges an equals the definite integralof f from a to b.**
**PROOFWe have shown in Section 4.2 on the Fundamental Theorem that thefunction**
***F(u)=******____ ******f(x)dx***
**iscontinuous on [*****a, b*****].Therefore**
**where ****___*****f(x)dx*****denotesthe definite integral.**
**Wenow define a second kind of improper integral where the interval isinfinite.**
**DEFINITION**
*Letf be continuous on the half-open interval[a,∝). The improperintegral of f from a to ∝ is defined by the limit*
*The improperintegral is said to converge if the limit exists and to divergeotherwise.*
Hereis description of this kind of improper integral using definiteintegrals with hyperreal endpoints.
*Let fbe continuous on [a,*∝).
(1) *___**f(x)dx =S ifand only if **___**f(x) dx*≈ *Sfor all positive infinite H. *
(2)*___**f(x)dx =*∞*(or-* ∞*)if and only if**___**f(x) dx is positive infinite (ornegative infinite ) for all positive *
*infinite H.*
**EXAMPLE4**Findthe area under the curve
*y= x*-3from1 to
∝.The area is given by the improper integral
For
Thus
Sothe improper integral converges and the region has area___.The
 region is shown in Figure 6.7.1(*b*)and extends infinitely far to the right.
**EXAMPLE5**Findthe area under the curve
*y=x*-2/3,1≤
*x*≤∝.
Theregion is shown in Figure 6.7.4 and has infinite area.

**Figure6.7.4**
**EXAMPLE6**
The regionin Example 5 is rotated about the
*x*-axis.Find the volume of the solid of revolution.
We usethe disc method because the rotation is about the axis of theindependent variable.
 The volume 
formula givesus an improper integral.
So thesolid shown in Figure 6.7.5 has finite
 volume *V=3π.*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/55/8155fa4dc44dacd04c1b976351926374.files/file0024.png)
Figure6.7.5
Thelast two examples give an unexpected result. A region with infinitearea is rotated about
 the *x*-axisand generates a solid with finite volume! In terms of hyperrealnumbers, the area of the region under the curve
*y*=*x*-2/3from1
 to an infinite hyperreal number *H*isequal to 3(
*H*1/3-1),which
 is positive infinite. But the volume of the solid of revolutionfrom 1 to *H*isequal to
3π(1-
*H*-1/3),
Whichis finite and has standard part 3π.
Wecan give a simpler example of this phenomenon. Let
*H*bea positive infinite hyperinteger, and form a cylinder of radius 1/*H*andlength
*H*²(Figure6.7.6). Then the cylinder is formed by
 rotating a rectangle of lengthH², width 1/*H*,and infinite area
*H²/H=H*.But the volume of the cylinder is equal to
*π,*
*V=π r*²*h = π*(1/*H*)²(*H*)²=*π.*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/55/8155fa4dc44dacd04c1b976351926374.files/file0025.png)
Imaginea cylinder made out of modelling clay, with initial length and radiusone. The volume is π. The clay is carefully stretched so that thecylinder gets longer
 and thinner. The volume stays the same, but thearea of the cross section keeps getting bigger. When the lengthbecomes infinite, the cylinder of clay still has finite volume
*V=π*,but the area of the cross section has become infinite.
Thereare other types of improper integrals. If
*f *is continuous onthe half - open interval [*a,b*] then we define
_______*f(x)dx* =________*f(x)dx.*
If*f* is continuous on (-∝,*b*] we define
_______*f(x)dx* =________*f(x)dx.*
Wehave introduced four types of improper integrals corresponding to thefour types of half - open intervals
[*a,b*),    [*a,*∞),   (*a,b]*,   (
*- *∞*,b*].
Bypiecing together improper integrals of these four types we can assignan improper integral to most functions which arise in calculus.
DEFINITION
*Afunction f is said to be**piecewise continuous** onan interval I if f is defined and continuous at all but perhapsfinitely many points of I. In particular, every continuous functionis piecewise continuous.*
Wecan introduce the improper integral
____*f(x)dx* whenever *f* is piecewise continuous on
*I *and*a,b* are either the endpoints of
*I* or the appropriateinfinity symbol. A few examples will show how this can be done.
Let*f* be continuous at every point of the closed interval[*a,b*]except at one point c where
*a<c<b.* We define
*_______**f(x)dx=**_____**f(x)dx+ **____**f(x)dx.*
**EXAMPLE7**
Find theimproper integral
____*x *-1/3 *dx.x *-1/3 is discontinuous at
*x*=0. The indefinite integral is
          ∫ *x*-1/3*dx = ___ x*2/3+
*C*.
Then
Similarly,
So
andthe improper integral converges. Thus, the region shown inFigure6.7.7 has finite area.

Figure6.7.7
If*f*is continuous on the open interval (*a, b*), theimproper integral is defined as the sum
where*c* is any point in the interval (*a,b*). The endpoints
*a*and *b* may be finite or infinite. It does not matter whichpoint
*c* is chosen, because if *e* is any other point in(*a,b*), then
**EXAMPLE 8**Find 
Thefunction 2/______ +1/____is continuous on the open interval (0, 2)but discontinuous
 at bothendpoints (Figure 6.7.8). Thus
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/55/8155fa4dc44dacd04c1b976351926374.files/file0027.png)

Figure6.7.8
Firstwe find the indefinite integral.
Then
Also
Therefore
**EXAMPLE9**  Find
Thefunction 1/*x*² + 1/(*x*-1)² is continuous on the openinterval (0,1) but discontinuous at both endpoints. The indefiniteintegral is
Wehave
Similarlywe find that
Inthis situation we may write
andwe say that the region under the curve in Figure 6.7.9 has infinitearea.

**Figure6.7.9**
**RemarkIn Example 9**
Weare faced with a sum of two infinite limits. Using the rules foradding infinite hyperreal
numbersas a guide we can give rules for sums of infinite limits.
If*H* and
*K* are positive infinite hyperreal numbers and *c*is finite, then
*H+ K* is positive infinite,
*H+ c* is positive infinite,
*-H- K* is negative infinite,
*-H+ c* is negative infinite,
*H-K*can be either finite, positive infinite, or negative infinite.
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/55/8155fa4dc44dacd04c1b976351926374.files/file0029.png)Byanalogy,
 we use the following rules for sums of two infinite limitsor of a finite and an infinite limit. These rules tell us when such asum can be considered to be positive or negative infinite. We use theinfinity symbols as a convenient shorthand, keeping in mind
 that theyare not even hyperreal numbers.

EXAMPLE10 Find
_____*xdx*. We see that 
and                 ______ *xdx* = ∞.
Thus ____*xdx*diverges and has the form ∞-∞. We do not assign it anyvalue or either of the symbols ∞ or -∞. The region under thecurve
*f(x)=x* is shown in Figure 6.7.10.

Figure6.7.10
Itis tempting to argue that the positive area to the right of theorigin and the negative area to the left exactly cancel each otherout so that the improper
 integral is zero. But this leads to aparadox.
Wrong:_____*xdx* =0. Let *v= x*+2,*dv= dx*. Then
Subtracting          
But                      ______ 2*dx*=∞
Sowe do not give the integral_____
*xdx *the value 0, and insteadleave it undefined.
