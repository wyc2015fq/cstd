Chapter 1 takes the student on a direct route to the point where it is possible to study derivatives. Sections 1.1 through 1.3 are
 reviews of precalculus material and can be skipped in many calculus courses.Section 1.4 gives an intuitive explanation of the hyperreal numbers and how they can be used to find slopes of curves. This section hasno problem set and is intended as the basis for
 an introductorylecture. The main content of Chapter 1 is in the last two sections,1.5 and 1.6. In these sections, the student will learn how to workwith the hyperreal numbers and in particular how to compute standardparts. Standard parts are used at the beginning
 of the next chapterto find derivatives of functions. Sections 1.5 and 1.6 take the placeof the beginning chapter on limits found in traditional calculustexts.
Forthe benefit of the interested student, we have included an Epilogueat the end of the book that presents the theory underlying
 thischapter.
1.1THE  REAL  LINE
Familiaritywith the real number system is a prerequisite for this course. Areview of the rules of algebra for the real numbers is
 given in theappendix. For convenience, these rules are also listed in a tableinside the front cover. The letter
*R* is used for the set ofall real numbers. We think of the real numbers as arranged along astraight line with the integers (whole numbers) marked off at equalintervals, as shown in Figure 1.1.1. This line is called the realline.

Ingrade school and high school mathematics, the real number system isconstructed gradually in several stages. Beginning with the
 positiveintegers, the systems of integers, rational numbers, and finally realnumbers are built up. One way to construct the set of real number isas the set of all nonterminating decimals.
Afterconstructing the real numbers, it is possible to prove the familiarrules for sums, differences, products, quotients, exponents,
 roots,and order. In this course, we take it for granted that these rulesare familiar to the student, so that we can proceed as quickly aspossible to the calculus.
Beforegoing on, we pause to recall two special points that are important inthe calculus. First, division by zero is never allowed.

arealways considered to be undefined.
Second,a positive real number
*c* always has two square roots, ______and
______ , and _____alwaysstands for the positive square root. Negative real numbers do nothave real square roots. For each positive real number
*c*,______ is positive and ___ isundefined.
Onthe other hand, every real number has one real cube root. If
*c*>0, *c* has the positive cube root ____,and
*-c* has the negative cube root_______=_____.
Incalculus, we often deal with sets of real numbers. By a set
*S*of real numbers, we mean any collection of real numbers, calledmembers of
*S*, elements of *S*, or points in *S*.
Asimple but important kind of set is an interval. Given two realnumbers
*a* and *b* with *a< b*, the closedinterval [*a, b*] is defined as the set of all real numbers
*x*such that *a *≤ *x* and *x*≤ *b*, or moreconcisely,
*a*≤*x*≤*b.*
Theopen interval (*a, b*) is defined as the set of all real numbers*x*such that *a<x<b*. Closed and open intervals areillustrated in Figure 1.1.2.

Figure1.1.2
F*orboth open and closed intervals, the number a is called the lowerendpoint, and b the upper endpoint. The difference between the closedinterval [a, b] and the open interval (a,b) is that the endpoints aand b are elements of [a, b] but are not elements of (a, b). Whena*≤*x*≤*b, we say that x is between a and b; whena<x<b, we say that x is strictly between a and b.*
*Threeother types of sets are also counted as open intervals: the set (a,*∞*) of all real numbers x greater than a; the set ( -*∞*,b) of all real numbers x less than b, and the whole real line R. Thereal line R is sometimes denoted by ( -*∞*,*∞*). Thesymbols *∞ *and -*∞*, read *“*infinity*”*and*“*minus infinity,*” *do not stand for numbers;they are only used to indicate an interval with no upper endpoint, orno lower endpoint.*
Besidesthe open and closed intervals, there is one other kind of
 interval,called a *half-open *interval.The set of all real numbers
*x*suchthat
*a*≤*x<b *isa
*half-open *intervaldenoted by [*a,b*).theset of all real numbers x such that
*a *≤*x*isalso a half-open interval and is written [*a,*∞).Here
 is a table showing the various kinds of intervals.

Welist some other important examples of sets of real numbers.
(1)Theempty set Ø, which has no elements.
(2)Thefinite set {
*a*1, ……, *a*n}, whose only elements arethe numbers
*a*1*,a*2*,……a*n*.*
(3)theset of all
*x* such that *x *≠ 0.
(4)Theset
*N* = {1,2,3,4,…} of all positive integers.
(5)Theset
*Z*={…, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,…} of all integers.
(6)Theset
*Q *of all rational numbers. *A *rational number is aquotient *m/n* where
*m* and *n *are integers and *n*≠0.
Whilereal numbers correspond to points on a line, ordered pairs of realnumbers correspond to points on a plane. This correspondence
 gives usa way to draw pictures of calculus problems and to translate physicalproblems into the language of calculus. It is the starting point ofthe subject called analytic geometry.
Anordered pair of real numbers, (*a, b*), is given by the firstnumber
*a *and the second number *b*. For example, (1,3),(3,1), and (1,1) are three different ordered pairs. Followingtradition, we use the same symbol for the open interval (*a,b*)and the ordered pair (*a,b*). However the open interval
 andordered pair are completely different things. It will always be quiteobvious from the context whether(*a,b*) stands for the openinterval or the ordered pair.
Wenow explain how ordered pairs of real numbers correspond to points ina plane. A system of rectangular coordinates in a plane is
 given by ahorizontal and a vertical copy of the real line crossing at zero. Thehorizontal line is called the horizontal axis, or
*x*-axis,while the vertical line is called the vertical axis, or *y*-axis.The point where the two axes meet is called the origin andcorresponds to the ordered pair (0,0). Now consider any point P inthe plane. A vertical line through
*P* will cross the *x*-axisat a real number *x*0, and a horizontal line through
*P*will cross the *y*-axis at a real number y0. The ordered pair(*x*0*, y*0) obtained in this way corresponds to the point*P*. (See Figure 1.1.3) We sometimes call
*P* the point(*x*0*,y*0) and sometimes write *P*(x0, y0).
*x*0 is called the*x*-coordinate of *P* and *y*0 the *y*-coordinateof *P.*
Conversely,given an ordered pair (*x*0,
*y*0) of real numbers there isa corresponding point 
*P*(*x*0,*y*0) in the plane. P(x0, y0) is the point of intersection ofthe vertical line crossing the
*x*-axis at *x*0 and thehorizontal line crossing the *y*-axis at
*y*0.
Wehave described a one-to-one correspondence between all points in theplane and all ordered pairs of real numbers.
Fromnow on, we shall simplify things by identifying points in the planewith ordered pairs of real numbers, as shown in Figure 1.1.4.

DEFINITION
The (*x,y*) plane is the set of all ordered pairs (*x, y*) of realnumbers. The origin is the point (0,0). The
*x*-axis is the setof all points of the form (*x*,0), and the *y*-axis is theset of all points of the form (0,*y*).
The*x*-and
*y*-axes divide the rest of the plane into fourparts called quadrants. The quadrants are numbered I through IV, asshown in Figure 1.1.5.
InFigure 1.1.6, P(*x1, y1*) and Q(*x2*,*y2*) are twodifferent points in the (*x,y*) plane. As we move
 from *P*to *Q*, the coordinates *x *and *y* will change byamounts that we denote by Δ*x* and Δ*y*. Thus
change in*x=*Δ*x=x*2-*x*1,
change in*y*= Δ*y*=
*y*2-*y*1,
Thequantities
Δ*x*and
Δ*y*may be positive, negative, or zero. For example, when
*x*2>*x*1,Δ*x*is positive, and when
*x*2<*x*1, Δ*x*is negative. Using
Δ*x*and
Δ*y*we define the basic notion of distance.

DEFINITION
The distancebetween the points
*P*(*x1,y1*)and
*Q*(*x2 , y2*) is the quantity
distance (*P,Q*)=
______________ =________________.
When wesquare both sides of the distance formula, we obtain
[ distance(*P, Q*)]² = (Δ*x*)² +(Δ*y*)²
Onecan also get this formula from the Theorem of Pythagoras in geometry:*the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the sum of thesquares of the sides.*
EXAMPLE1  Find the distance between
*P*(7,2) and *Q*(4, 6)(see Figure 1.1.7).
Δ*x*=4-7 = -3 ,          Δ*y*=6-2 = 4.
distance (*P,Q*) =
_____=5.
Weoften deal with sets of points in the plane as well as on the line.One way to describe a set of points in the plane is by an equation
 orinequality in two variables, say *x* and *y*. A solution ofan equation in
*x* and *y* is a point (*x*0*,y*0)in the plane for which the equation
 is true. The set of all solutionsis called the locus, or graph, of the equation. The circle is animportant example of a set of points in the plane.

DEFINITION OF  CIRCLE
*Theset of all points in the plane at distance r from a point P is calledthe circle of*
*radius rand center P.*
Using thedistance formula, we see that the circle of radius r and center
 atthe origin(Figure 1.1.8) is the locus of the equation
*x²+ y² = r²*
*Thecircle of radius r and center at P(h,k) (Figure 1.1.8) is the locusof the equation*
*(x-h) ²+ (y-k) ² = r² .*

*P*(2,-4)has the equation
(*x*-2)²+(
