        在抽象代数中，群、环、域是三种数学结构。对于学习无穷小微积分而言，域的知识是必不可少的。

域的公理化定义如下：
        Formally, a fieldis a set F together with two operations called addition and multiplication.[1]An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to every pairof its elements. The result of the addition of a and b is called the sum of aand b and denoted a + b. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of a and bis called the product of a and b, and denoted ab or a?b. These operations are required to satisfythe following properties, referred to as field axioms. In the followingdefinitions, a, b and c are arbitrary elements of the field F.
    Associativity of addition andmultiplication: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c.
    Commutativity of addition andmultiplication: a + b = b + a and a · b = b · a.
    Additive and multiplicativeidentity: there exist two different elements 0 and 1 in F such that a + 0 = aand a · 1 = a.
    Additive inverses: for everya in F, there exists an element in F, denoted ?a, called additive inverse of a,such that a + (?a) = 0.
    Multiplicative inverses: forevery a ≠ 0 in F, there exists anelement in F, denoted by a?1, 1/a, or 1/a, called the multiplicative inverse ofa, such that a · a?1 = 1.
    Distributivity of multiplicationover addition: a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c) .（全文完）
