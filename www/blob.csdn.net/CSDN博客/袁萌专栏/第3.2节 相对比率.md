3.2 RELATED RATES
In a related rates problem, we are given the rate of change of one quantity and wish to find the rate of change of another. Such
 problems can often be solved by implicit differentiation.
EXAMPLE 1
The point of a fountain pen is placed on an ink blotter, forming a circleof ink whose area increases at the constant rate of 0.03
 in. ²/sec.Find the rate at which the radius of the circle is changing when thecircle has a radius of*____* inch.We solve the problem in four steps.
Step1  Label all quantities involved and draw a diagram.
t =time  *A =*area     *r *=radius of circle
Both*A*and
*r *are functions of *t*. The diagram is shownin Figure 3.2.1.

Figure3.2.1
Step1  Write the given information in the form of equations.
*dA/dt*= 0.03.     *A*= π*r*².
The problemis to find*dr/dt* when
*r *=1/2.
Step3   Differentiate both sides of the equation*A* =π*r*². with respect to
*t*.

Step4  Set*r*= ___ and solve for*dr/dt.*

EXAMPLE 2 
A10 foot ladder is propped against a wall. The bottom end is beingpulled along the floor away from the wall at the constant rate
 of2ft/sec. Find the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding downthe wall when the bottom end is 5ft from the wall.
*Warning*: although the bottom end of the ladder is being moved at aconstant rate, the rate at which the top end moves will
 vary withtime.
Step1 *t*=time,
*x=* distance of the bottom end from the wall,
*y*= height of the top end above the floor.
Thediagram is shown in Figure 3.2.2.

Figure3.2.2
Step2*dx/dt* = 2, 
*x²+y²* =10² =100.
Step3  we differentiate both sides of*x²+y²* =100withrespect to
*t*.
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0027.png)
Step4  Set*x*=5 ft and solve for
*dy/dt*. We first findthe value of *y* when*x*=5.
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0028.png)*x²+y²*=100,   
Then wecan solve for*dy/dt.*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0029.png)
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0030.png)
Thesing of*dy/dt* is negative because
*y* is decreasing.
Relatedrates problems have the following form.
*Given:*
(a)Twoquantities which depend on time, say*x*
 and *y*.
*(b)*Therate of change of one of them,
 say *dx/dt.*
*(c)*Anequation showing the relationship
 between *x* and *y.*
(Usuallythis information is given in the form of a verbal description of aphysical situation and part of the problem is to express
 it in theform of an equation.)
*Theproblem: Find the rate of change of y, dy/dt, at a certain time t0. (the time t0 is sometimes specified by giving the value whichx, or y, has at that time.)*
Relatedrates problems can frequently be solved in four steps as we did inthe examples.
Step1   Label all quantities in the problem and draw a picture.If the labels are*x, y,*
and *t*(time ). The remaining steps are as follows:
Step2  Write an equation for the given rate of change*dx/dt.*Write another equation for the   
given relationbetween x and y.
Step3  Differentiate both sides of the equation relating*x*and
*y *with respect to *t*. 
We choosethe time*t* as the independent variable.
The resultis a new equation involving*x, y, dx/dt,*and*dy/dt.*
Step4  *Set t=t0 and solve for dy/dt. It may be necessary tofind the values of x, y, and dx/dt at t=t0 first.*
Thehardest step is usually step 2, because one has to start with thegiven verbal description of the problem and set up as a system
 offormulas. Sometimes more than two quantities that depend on time aregiven. Here is an example with three.
EXAMPLE3 
Onecar moves north at 40mph (miles per hour) and passes a point*P*at time 1:00. Another car moves east at 60 mph and passes
 the samepoint*P* at time 2:30. How fast is the distance between the twocars changing at the time 2:00?
Itit not even easy to tell whether the two cars are getting closer orfarther away at time 2:00. This is part of the problem.
Step1 *t*= time,
*y*=position of the first car travelling north,
*x*=position of the second car travelling east,
*z*=distance between the two cars.
In thediagram in Figure 3.2.3, the point*P* is placed at the origin.

Figure3.2.3
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0032.png)Step2     
*x²+ y² =z².*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0033.png)Step3  
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0034.png)
Step4 Wefirst find the values of*x, y*and*z*atthe
 time*t*=2hrs. We are given that when*t*=1,
*y*=0. In
 the next hour the car goes 40 miles, so at *t*=2,*y*=40.
We aregiven that
 at time *t*=__,*x*=0.One
 -half hour before that the car was 30 miles to 
the leftof*P*,so
 at*t *=2,*x*=-30. To sum up,
at *t* =2,  *y*=40  and
*x*= -30.
We cannow find the value of*z*at*t =*2,
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0035.png)
Finally, wesolve for*dz/dt*at *t *=2
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0036.png)
Thenegative sign shows that*z* is decreasing. Therefore at 2:00the cars are getting closer to each other at the rate
 of 4 mph.
EXAMPLE 4 
Thepopulation of a country is growing at the rate of one million peopleper year, while gasoline consumption is decreasing by one
 billiongallons per year. Find the rate of change of the per capita gasolineconsumption when the population is 30 million and total gasolineconsumption is 15 billion gallons per year.106
Bythe per capita gasoline consumption we mean the total consumptiondivided by the population.
Step1 *t*= time
*x*= population
*y* =gasoline consumption
*z*= per capita gasoline consumption.
Step2   At*t*=
*t*0,
*dx/dt*= 1million = 106
*dy/dt*= -1 billion = -109
*z=y/x.*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0037.png)Step3  
Step4   at t= t0, we are given
*x*= 30 million =30×106
*y* =15 billion = 15×109
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0038.png)Thus          
Theper capita gasoline consumption is decreasing at the annual rate of50 gallons per person.
Weconclude with another example from economics. In this example theindependent variable is the quantity*x* of a commodity.
 Thequantity *x* which can be sold at price *p* is called the*demand function D(p).*
*x=D(p).*
Whena quantity*x* is sold at price
*p*, the revenue is theproduct
*R= px.*
Theadditional revenue from the sale of an additional unit of thecommodity is called the*marginal revenue*andis given by the derivative
*marginal revenue= dR/dx.*
EXAMPLE 5 Suppose the demand for a product is equal to the inverse of thesquare of the
price. Findthe marginal revenue when the price is $10 per unit.
Step1  *p*= price,
*x*= demand, *R*= revenue.
Step2  *x*=1/*p²*,  
*R=px*
Step3  
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0039.png)
soby the Inverse Function Rule,
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0040.png)
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/73/4073693e50a10d231444d6f1f9042712.files/file0041.png)Substituting,   
Step4  We are given*p*=$10. Therefore the marginal revenue is
*dR/dx= $*5.
106
Anadditional unit sold would bring in an additional revenue of $5.
