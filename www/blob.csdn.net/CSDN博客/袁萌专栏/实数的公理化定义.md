        在域的公理化定义基础上，容易给出实数的公理化定义，如下文所述。
        说明：1961年，美国数学家鲁宾逊在实数公理化基础上，利用数理逻辑模型论紧致性定理，证明实数的非标准模型存在，这就是超实数需要的诞生。由此，无穷小微积分就名正言顺了。

附：实数的公理化定义：
    Let denote the set of all real numbers. Then:
    The set ? is a field, meaning that addition and multiplicationare defined and have the usual properties.
    The field ? is ordered, meaning that there is a totalorder ≥ such that, for all realnumbers x, y and z:
    if x ≥ y ，then x + z ≥ y + z;
    if x ≥ 0 and y ≥0， then xy ≥ 0.
    The order is Dedekind-complete;that is: every non-empty subset S of ? with an upper bound in ? has a least upper bound (also called supremum) in
        The last propertyis what differentiates the reals from the rationals. For example, the set ofrationals with square less than 2 has a rational upper bound (e.g., 1.5) but norational least upper bound, because the square root of 2 is not rational.
        These propertiesimply Archimedean property (which is not implied by other definitions ofcompleteness). That is, the set of integers is not upper-bounded in the reals.In fact, if this were false, then the integers would have a least upper boundN; then, N – 1 would not be an upper bound, and there would be an integer nsuch that n > N – 1, and thus n + 1 > N, which is a contradiction withthe upper-bound property of N.（全文完）
