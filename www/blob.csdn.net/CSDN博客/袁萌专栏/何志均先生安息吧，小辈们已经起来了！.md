**何志均先生安息吧，小辈们已经起来了！**
**      6****月****5****日上午****10****点，浙江大学何志均先生的遗体告别仪式在杭州举行。**
**      记得，在****1981****年中国人工智能学会成立大会上，我第一次与何志均先生相识。****1983****年，浙江大学人工智能研究所成立，何先生出任所长，开创国内人工智能研究的新局面。　**
**      围绕人工智能的是是非非，随着老一辈的离去而逐渐消失，机器人终将成为人类的一部分。**
**      2016****年****3****月****16****日，为纪念人工智能学科确立****60****周年，英国舆观（****YouGov****）网站进行了一次舆论在线抽样调查（样本****2000****人），发现：**
**    1****） 60 percent think that the use of robots or programmes equipped with artificialintelligence (AI) will lead to fewer jobs within ten years**
**      2****）****36 per cent of the public believe that the development of AI poses athreat****（构成威胁）**** to the long termsurvival****（长期生存） of humanity.**
**    3****）Many of the respondents felt negatively aboutthe short term effects of the rise of artificial intelligence, with 60 per centthinking that their rise will lead to fewer jobs by 2026, with 27     per centpredicting that it will decrease the number of jobs ‘a lot’.**
**    4****）Almost half of those questioned (46 per cent)opposed the idea of robots or programming being equipped with emotions or apersonality, meaning that pop culture favourite robots in films such as Wall-Eor Ex Machina might prove unpopular in real life.**
**    5****）It seems that the public largely doesn’ttrust intelligent machines to take on roles where lives could be in danger. Thepoll found that approximately half of those surveyed would not trust robots inroles including surgical procedures (53 per cent), driving public buses (49 percent) or flying commercial aircraft (62 per cent).**
**    6****）The preferred roles for intelligent machineswould be to carry out household tasks (e.g. cooking and cleaning) for olderpeople or disabled people (49 per cent), to fly unmanned search and rescue (48per cent) or unmanned military (45 per cent) aircraft or as monitors for crops(70 per cent).**
**    7****）The survey found that opinions on artificialintelligence differed by age or sex. Perhaps surprisingly, only 17 per cent ofwomen felt optimistic about their development, compared to 28 per cent of men.13 per cent of men believe they could be friends with a robot (as opposed to 6per cent of women) and one in five men (22 per cent) think that intelligentrobots could be trusted to carry out sex work (vs. just 13 per cent of women).**
**    8****）****Those aged 18 - 24 years old were the mostopen minded about a future that includes artificial intelligence, with one infour (28 per cent) envisaging****（想像） that robotscould be future co-workers and ten per cent thinking that they could regardthem as family members. More than half of this age bracket (55 per cent) alsothought that intelligent machines could take up the role of servants in ahousehold.**
**      根据上述第****8****）点，我们可以看出，年轻一代会把机器人视为自己的同伴。时代在进步，老一辈可以休息了。**
