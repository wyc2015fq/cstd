3.8 PROPERTIES  OF  CONTINUOUS  FUNCTIONS
This section develops some theory that will be needed for integration in Chapter 4. We begin with a new concept, that of a* hyperinteger.*The
 hyperintegers are to the integers as the hyperreal numbers are to the real numbers. The hyperintegers consist of the ordinary finite integers, the positive infinite hyperintegers, and the negative infinite hyperintegers. The hyperintegers have the same algebraic
 properties as the integers and are spaced one apart all along the hyperreal line as in Figure 3.8.1.

Figure 3.8.1   The Set of Hyperintegers
The rigorous definition of the hyperintegers uses the greatest integer function [*x*] introduced in Section 3.4, Example 6. Remember
 that for a real number *x*, [*x*] is the greatest integer *n *
such that *n* ≤ *x*. A real number *y* is itself an integer if and only if*y*= [*x*] for some real
*x*.To get the hyperintegers, we apply the function [*x*] to hyperreal number*x* (see Figure 3.8.2).

DEFINITION
*A hyperinteger is a hyperreal number y such that y=[x] for some hyperreal x.*
When *x* varies over the hyperreal numbers, [*x*] is the greatest hyperinteger*y*such that*y* ≤
*x*. Because of the Transfer Principle, every hyperreal number*x* is between two hyperintegers [*x*] and [*x*] + 1,
[*x*] ≤*x*≤ [*x*]+1.
Also,sums, differences, and products of hyperintegers are again hyperintegers.
We are now going to use the hyperintegers. In sketching curves we divided a closed interval [*a, b*] into
 finitely many subintervals. For theoretical purposes in the calculus we often divide a closed interval into a finite or infinite number of equal subintervals. This is done as follows.
Given a closed real interval [*a, b*], a* finite partition* is formed by choosing a positive integer*n*
 and dividing [*a, b*] into *n* equal parts, as in Figure 3.8.3. Each part will be a subinterval of length*t*= (*b-a*)/*n*. The
*n* subintervals are 
[*a,a+t*]*, *[*a+t, a+2t*]*, ……,*[*a+*(*n-*1)*t, b*]*.*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0003.png)
Figure 3.8.3
The endpoints
*a, a+t, a+2t, ……, a+ (n-1)t, a+nt = b*
are called partition points.
The real interval [*a,b*] is contained in the* hyperreal*interval [*a,b*]*, which is the set
 of all hyperreal numbers* x *such that *a ≤ x ≤ b*. An infinite partition is applied to the hyperreal interval [*a,b*]* rather than the real interval.To form an infinite partition of [*a,b*]*, choose a positive infinite hyperinteger*H*
 and divide [*a,b*]* into *H *equal parts as shown in Figure 3.8.4. Each subinterval will have the same infinitesimal length* δ = (b-a)/H*. The*H*subintervals are
[ *a,a+δ*]*,*[
*a+δ, a+2δ*], ……[*a+*(*K-*1)*δ,a+Kδ*]*, ……*[*a+*(*H*-1)*δ, b*],
and the partition points are
*a,a+δ,a+2δ, ……a+Kδ**，*……*a+Hδ = b,*
Where* K*runs over the hyperintegers from 1 to
*H*. Every hyperreal number *x *between *a* and *b* belongs to one of the infinitesimal subintervals,
*a+*(*K-1*)*δ* ≤*x <a+Kδ.*

We shall now use infinite partitions to sketch the proofs of three basic results, called the Intermediate Value
 Theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem, and Rolle’s Theorem. The use of these results will be illustrated by studying zeros of continuous functions. By a zero of a function*f* we mean a point* c* where
*f(c)* = 0. As we can see in Figure 3.8.5, the zeros of* f* are the points where the curve* y = f(x)*intersects the
*x*-axis.

INTERMEDIATE VALUE  THEOREM
*Suppose the real function f is continuous on the closed interval [a,b] and f(x) is positive at one*
*endpoint and negative at the other endpoint. Then f has a zero in the interval (a,b) ; that is, f(c) = 0**for some real c in (a,b).*
*Discussion* There are two cases illustrated in Figure 3.8.6:
*f(a) < 0 < f(b)    and   f(a) > 0 > f(b).*

Figure 3.8.6
Inthe first case, the theorem says that if a continuous curve is belowthe*x*-axis at*a* and above it at*b*, then
 thecurve must intersect the*x*-axis at some point*c* between*a* and*b*. Theorem 3 in the preceding Section 3.7 oncurve sketching is simply a reformulation of the Intermediate ValueTheorem.
*SKETCH OF  PROOF*  We assume*f(a)*≤
*0 *≤*f(b)*. Let *H* be a positive infinite hyperinteger andpartition
the interval[*a,b*]* into*H* equal parts
*a,a+ δ, a+ 2δ,……a+Hδ = b.*
Let*a+Kδ* be the last partition point at which*f(a+Kδ)* <0. Thus
*f(a+Kδ)< 0*≤*f(a+ (K+1)δ).*
Since*f* is continuous,*f(a+Kδ)* is infinitely close to*f(a+(K+1)δ)*. We conclude that*f(a+ Kδ)* ≈ 0 (Figure3.8.7).
 We take *c* to be the standard part of*a+ Kδ*, sothat 
*f(c)= st (f (a + Kδ))* = 0.
EXAMPLE1  The function
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0008.png)
Which isshown in Figure 3.8.8, is continuous for 0≤*x* ≤ 1.Moreover,
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0009.png)*f*(0)=
 1, 
The IntermediateValue Theorem shows that*f(x)* has a zero*f(c)* = 0 forsome*c* between 0 and 1.

Figure 3.8.8
TheIntermediate Value Theorem can be used to prove Theorem 3 of Section3.7 on curve sketching:
*Supposeg is a continuous function on an interval I, and g(x)*≠*0for all x in I.*
*(i) If g(c) > 0 for at least one c in I, then g(x) >0 for all x inI.*
*(ii) If g(c)<0 for at least one c in I, then g(x) <0 for all x in I.*
*PROOF(i)*  Let*g(c)* > 0 for some*c* in I. If*g(x1)*< 0 for some other point*x1* in
*I*, then by theIntermediate Value
Theorem thereis a point*x2* between*c* and*x1* such that
*g*(*x2*)= 0, contrary to hypothesis (Figure 3.8.9).
Therefore weconclude that*g(x) >*0 for all*x* in*I*.

EXTREME VALUE  THEOREM
*Letf be continuous on its domain, which is a closed interval [a, b].Then f has a maximum at some point in [a, b], and a minimum at somepoint in [a, b].*
Discussion 
Wehave seen several examples of functions that do not have maxima on anopen interval, such as*f(x) =*1/*x*
on( 0, ∞), or*g(x) =*2*x*on (0, 1). The Extreme ValueTheorem says that on a closed interval a continuous function alwayshas
 maximum.
*SKETCH OF  PROOF*    Form an infinite partition of[*a, b*]*,
*a,a+δ, a+2δ,……**，**a+Hδ=b*
By theTransfer Principle, there is a partition point*a+ Kδ* at which*f(a+ Kδ )* has the largest value.
Let *c*be the standard part of*a + Kδ* (see Figure 3.8.10). Any point*u*of [*a, b*]* lies in a subinterval,
 say
*a,Lδ, ≤ u < a+*(*L*+1)*δ.*
We have                     *f(a + Kδ)*≥*f(a + Lδ)*
and takingstandard parts,
*f(c)*≥*f(u)*
Thisshows that*f* has a maximum at*c.*

ROLLE’S  THEOREM
*Supposethat f is continuous on the closed interval [ a, b] anddifferentiable on the open interval (a, b). If*
*f(a) =f(b) = 0,*
*thenthere is at least one point c strictly between a and b where f hasderivative zero; i. e.,*
*f*′*(c)* = 0        for some*c* in (*a, b*).
Geometrically,the theorem says that a differentiable curve touching the*x*-axisat*a* and*b*
 must be horizontal for at least one pointstrictly between*a*and*b.*
Proof  We may assume that [*a, b*] is the domain of*f.*Bythe Extreme Value Theorem,*f* has a maximum value
*M*and a minimum value*m* in [*a, b*]. Since*f(a)*= 0,*m*≤ 0 and *M* ≥ 0 (see Figure 3.8.11).
*Case1  M* = 0*m* = 0. Then*f* is the constantfunction*f(x)* = 0, and therefore*f ′(c)*= 0 for allpoints *c* in (*a, b*).
*Case2*M > 0. Let*f* have a maximum at*c*,
*f(c) = M*.By the Critical Point Theorem,*f* has a critical point at*c*.*c*
cannot bean endpoint because the value of*f(x)* is zero at the endpointsand positive at*x= c*.
By hypothesis,*f ′(x)*exists at*x=c*. It follows that*c* mustbe a critical point of the type*f ′(c)*=
 0.
*Case3  m* < 0. We let*f* have a minimum at*c*.Then as in Case 2,*c* is in (*a, b*) and*f ′(c)*
 =0.

Figure 3.8.11  Rolle’s Theorem
EXAMPLE 2
*f(x)= (x-1)² (x-2) ³* ,*a*= 1,*b*=2. The function*f*is continuous and differentiable everywhere (Figure
 3.8.12).Moreover,*f*(1) =*f*(2) =0. Therefore by Rolle’sTheorem there is a point*c* in (1, 2) with*f ′(c)*= 0.
Let usfind such a point c. We have
*f ′(x)= 3(x-*1*)² (x-2)²  + 2(x-1) (x-2) ³ = (x -1) (x-2)²(5x-7).*

Noticethat*f ′*(1) = 0 and*f ′*(2) = 0. But Rolle’sTheorem says that there is another point*c* which is in the*open*![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0020.png)*interval*(1,2)

Then *f(a)= f(b)* = 0.

 that there is at least one point c in            at which *f ′(c) *= 0. 
As amatter of fact there are three such points,
*c*= -1,  *c* = 0,   *c* =1.
We canfind these points as follows:
*f′(x) = 2x³ - 2x = 2x(x²-1),*
*f ′(x)= 0   when  x= 0  or x=*+1.

*a*=-1,*b*=1. Then*f*(-1) =*f*(1) = 0. Then function
*f*is continuous on [-1,1] and has a derivative at each point of (-1,1),as Rolle’s Theorem requires (Figure 3.8.14). Note, however, that*f′(x)* does not exist at either endpoint,*x*= -1 or
*x*=1.By Rolle’s Theorem there is a point*c* in (-1,1) such that*f′(c)* = 0,*c*= 0 is such a point,![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0025.png)because

EXAMPLE5
*f(x)*=1-*x*2/3, *a*= -1,*b*=1. Then
*f*(-1) =*f*(1) =0, and*f ′(x)* =_______for*x* ≠ 0.
*f *′(0) is undefined. There is nopoint*c* in (-1,1) at which*f ′(c)* = 0. Rolle’sTheorem does not apply in this case because*f ′(x)* does notexist at one of the points of the interval (-1,1), namely at*x*=0.In Figure 3.8.15,
 we see that instead of being horizontal at a pointin the interval, the curve has a sharp peak.
Rolle’sTheorem is useful in finding the number of zeros of a differentiablefunction*f.* It shows that between any two zeros of*f*there
 must be one or more zeros of*f ′*. It follows that if *f*′ has no zeros in an interval*I* , then*f*cannot havemore than one zero in*I*.
EXAMPLE 6  
Howmany zeros does the function*f(x) = x³ + x*+1 have ? We useboth Rolle’s Theorem and the Intermediate Value Theorem.
UsingRolle’s Theorem:*f ′(x)* = 3*x²* + 1. For all*x*,*x²* ≥ 0, and hence*f ′(x)* ≥ 1. Therefore*f(x)*has
 at most one zero.
Usingthe intermediate value theorem: we have f(-1) = -1, f(0) =1.
Thereforef has at least one zero between -1 and 0.
*CONCLUSION f has exactly one zero, and it lies between -1 and 0*( seeFigure 3.8.16).

Figure3.8.16
Ourmethod of sketching curves in Section 3.7 depends on a consequence ofRolle’s Theorem called the Mean Value Theorem. It deals with
 theaverage slope of a curve between two points.
DEFINITION
*Let fbe defined on the closed interval [a,b]. The average slope of fbetween a and b is the quotient*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0029.png)
Wecan see in Figure 3.8.17 that the average slope of*f* between*a*and*b* is equal to the slope of the line passing
 through thepoints*(a, f(a))* and*(b, f(b))*. This is shown by thetwo-point equation for a line (Section 1.3). In particular, if*f*is already a linear function*f(x) = mx + c*, then the averageslope of*f* between
*a* and*b* is equal to the slopem of the line*y=f(x).*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0030.png)
Figure3.8.17   Average  Slope
Thisis shown by the two-point equation for a straight line (Section 1.2).In particular, if*f* is already a linear function*f(x) = mx+ c*, then the average slope of*f* between *a* and*b*is equal to the slope*m* of the straight line
*y=f(x).*
MEAN VALUE  THEOREM
*Assumethat f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and has aderivative at every point of the open*
*interval (a,b).Then there is at least one point c in (a,b) where the slope f(c) isequal to the average*
*slope off between a and b,*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0031.png)
*Remark* In the special case that*f(a) = f(b)* = 0, the Mean ValueTheorem becomes Rolle’s Theorem:
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0032.png)
Onthe other hand, we shall use Rolle’s Theorem in the proof of theMean Value Theorem. The Mean Value Theorem is illustrated in Figure3.8.18.
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0033.png)

Figure3.8.18  the Mean Value Theorem
*PROOFOF THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM*
*Letm be the average slope, m= ( f(b) - f(a)) / (b-a). The line throughthe points (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) has the equation*
*ι(x) = f(a) + m(x-a).*
*Leth(x) be the distance of f(x) above I(x),*
*h(x)= f(x) - ι(x).*
*Thenh is continuous on [a,b] and has the derivative*
*h′(x)= f ′(x) - ι*′*(x) = f ′(x) - m*
*ateach point in (a,b). Since f(x) = ι(x) at the endpoints a and b, wehave*
*h(a)= 0,  h(b) = 0.*
ThereforeRolle’s Theorem can be applied to the function*h*, and thereis a point*c* in (*a, b*) such that*h′(c)*=
 0.Thus
*0=h′(c) = f ′(c) - ι* ′*(c) = f ′(c) - m,*
Whence                   *f ′(c) = m.*
Wecan give a physical interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem in termsof velocity. Suppose a particle moves along the y-axis according
 tothe equation *y=f(t)*. The *average velocity *of theparticle between times*a* and*b* is the ratio
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0034.png)
ofthe change in position to the time elapsed. The Mean Value Theoremstates that there is a point of time*c, a<c<b*, when thevelocity*f ′(c) *of the particle is equal to the averagevelocity between times*a* and*b.*
Theorems1 and 2 in Section 3.7 on curve sketching are consequences of theMean Value Theorem. As an illustration, we prove part (ii)
 ofTheorem1:
*Iff ′(x) > 0 for all interior points x of I, then f is increasingon I.*
PROOF Let*x*1*<x*2 where*x*1 and*x*2 are pointsin
*I*. By the Mean Value Theorem there is a point*c*strictly
between *x*1and*x*2 such that
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0035.png)
Since*c* is an interior point of*I, f ′(c)* > 0. Because*x*1<*x*2, *x*2-*x*1 > 0 .
Thus
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/4f/a74fc92d41f6680424cfd2430c7c0e3a.files/file0036.png)
Thisshows that*f* is increasing on*I*.
