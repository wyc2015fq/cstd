回答这个问题，我们必须实事求是，言之有据，不能拍脑袋胡说。
J.Keisler在“ElementaryCalculus”第一版前言中写道：“I（J.Keisleer） was originallyled to write this book when it became clear that Robinson's infinitesimalcalculus could be made available to college freshmen. The theory is simplypresented; for example, Robinson's work used mathematical logic, but this bookdoes not. I first used an early draft of this book in a one-semester course atthe
University of Wisconsin in 1969. In 1971 a two-semester experimentalversion was
published. It has been used at several colleges and at Nicolet HighSchool near
Milwaukee, and was tested at five schools in a controlled experiment bySister Kathleen
Sullivan in 1972-1974. The results (in her 1974 Ph.D. thesis at theUniversity of
Wisconsin) show the viability of the infinitesimal approach and will besummarized
in an article in the American Mathematical Monthly（美国数学月刊）.”
Keisler的这段话明显地表明：该微积分教材完全适合上世纪中叶美国大学新生以及高中学生的学习微积分的使用。中国的00后大学生难道不如当时的美国年轻人？非也！
