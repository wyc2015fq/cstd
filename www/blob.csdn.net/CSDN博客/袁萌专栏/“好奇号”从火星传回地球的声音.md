         8月27日，美国航天局（NASA）公布了一段从地球发往火星“好奇号”，然后，再由火星“好奇号”发回地球的声音（英语）。这是人类历史上第一次实现行星际语音通信。。
只要你听一下这段讲话，你一定认为：从火星传回的人类语音十分清晰有力，没有丝毫杂音。注意：这段语音可在以下网址收听：[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/bolden20120827.html](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/bolden20120827.html)
语音内容如下：
         "“Hello.This is Charlie Bolden, NASA Administrator, speaking to you via the broadcast capabilities of the Curiosity Rover, which is now on the surface
 of Mars. 
        Since the beginning of time, humankind’s curiosity has led us to constantly seek new life…new possibilities just beyond the horizon.I want to congratulate
 the men and women of our NASA family as well as our commercial and government partners around the world, for taking us a step beyond to Mars.
This is an extraordinary achievement. Landing a rover on Mars is not easy– others have tried – only America has fully succeeded. The investment we are making…the
 knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of Gale Crater, will tell us much about the possibility of life on Mars as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet. Curiosity will bring benefits to Earth and inspire a new generation
 of scientists and explorers, as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future.
Thank you. ”
由于“好奇号”距离地球十分遥远，从地球到火星，无线电波需要14分钟才能达到，一个来回需要近半个小时。此事能否造假，那是我们的（习惯）想法。
