        在数学中，环与群都是很重要的数学结构。
        记得，我的毕业论文题目就是关于素性环的几个定理（已发表）。
        环（Ring）的公理化定义如下：
A ring is a set Requipped with two binary operations[1] + and · satisfying the following threesets of axioms, called the ring axioms
**公理1. R is anabelian group under addition, meaning that:**
        (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)for all a, b, c in R   (that is, + isassociative).
        a + b = b + a for all a,b in R   (that is, + is commutative).
     There is an element 0 in Rsuch that a + 0 = a for all a in R  (that is, 0 is the additive identity).
        For each a in R thereexists ?a in R such that a + (?a) = 0  (that is, ?a is the additive inverse of a).
**公理2. R is a monoidunder multiplication, meaning that:**
        (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)for all a, b, c in R   (that is, · isassociative).
        There is an element 1 inR such that a · 1 = a and 1 · a = a for all a in R   (that is, 1 is the multiplicative identity).
**公理3. Multiplicationis distributive with respect to addition:**
        a ? (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c) for all a, b,c in R   (left distributivity).
        (b + c) · a = (b · a) +(c · a) for all a, b, c in R   (rightdistributivity).
