上世纪60年代，鲁宾逊深入研读莱布尼兹数学手稿（未发表的），有许多发现与心得。
鲁宾逊高度赞美莱布尼兹关于实无穷小微积分的创新思想，为此，鲁宾逊特推崇他为现代非标准分析的先行者。
本文附件，记录了鲁宾逊有关的原话，请读者一阅。

附件：**Abraham Robinson. He wrote:**
[...] the idea of infinitely small or infinitesimal quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition. At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus. As for the objection [...] that the distance between two distinct real numbers cannot be infinitely small, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz argued that the theory of infinitesimals implies the introduction of ideal numbers which might be infinitely small or infinitely large compared with the real numbers but which were to possess the same properties as the latter
Robinson argued that this law of continuity of Leibniz's is a precursor of the transfer principle. Robinson continued:（以下省略）
