      进入Canonical的官方网站的首页，有三个主打产品：企业服务，工程服务与客户服务。根据国际标准组织（ISO）的定义，服务（Service）是一种产品形式。由此可以断定：Canonical是一个新型的服务提供商（SP），Ubuntu操作系统只是它手中的一张“王牌”而已。
## 3月21日，Canonical在其官方网站“News and Events”栏目中，第一条新闻就是：”Canonical and Chinese standards body announce Ubuntu collaboration“，意思是，Canonical与中国的标准组织宣布Ubuntu合作协议，要点如下：
一、CSIP defines a new reference architecture for standard
 operating systems in China
二、CSIP,Canonical and NUDT from the CCN Open Source
 Innovation Joint Lab to further that standard
三、CCN Joint Lab will produce Ubuntu Kylin, with first release expected
 in conjunction with Ubuntu 13.04 in April 2013.
其中第一条表明：CSIP是中国标准操作系统新基准平台的制定者；第二条表明：Canonical与CSIP将进一步推进、完善该项标准；第三条表明：该新标准的载体Ubuntu麒麟定于今年4月份发布。
这个新标准涉及哪些方面呢？答曰：“across the full range of platforms: desktop,
 server, cloud, tablet and phone.”除去冠冕堂皇的“外包装”，从本质上来看，Ubuntu麒麟事件的要害是：CSIP中国IT标准制定者勾结该标准实施的服务提供商企图包揽整个中国信息产业操作系统平台业务，互谋私利。这是典型的官商勾结案例。
以下是Canonical官方声明的原文：
**”London and Beijing, 21 March 2013**:The
 China Software and Integrated Chip Promotions Centre (CSIP) today announced a new reference architecture for Chinese operating systems.CSIP, which is a part of the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MII), has selected Canonical’s Ubuntu
 as the basis for that reference architecture in order to provide a flexible, open, widely-used and standardised operating system. The announcement helps strengthen the Chinese
 government's five year plan to promote open source software and accelerate the growth of the open source ecosystem within China.
Additionally,CSIP, Canonical and the National University of Defense Technology(NUDT) have formed the CCN Open Source Innovation Joint Lab in Beijing. The Joint Lab hosts engineers
 from each organisation who will accelerate the development of a China-focused version of Ubuntu for desktop and cloud.
"CSIP, Canonical and NUDT sharethe goal of widespread adoption of high quality Linux on personal devices  and in the cloud," said Jane Silber, CEO of Canonical. "This collaboration will bring local investment andparticipation to ensure that the platform is
 relevant for the Chinesemarket, and close coordination with the global Ubuntu project ensures that it is familiar to software and hardware vendors, and useful for export products made by Chinese companies as well."
The initial work of the CCN Joint Lab is focused on the development of an enhanced version of the Ubuntu desktop with features specific to the Chinese market. The new version is called Ubuntu Kylin and the first version will be released in April 2013 in conjunction
 with Ubuntu’s global release schedule. Future work will extend beyond the desktop to other platforms.
Ubuntu Kylin goes beyond language localisation and includes features and applications that cater for the Chinese market. In the 13.04 release, Chinese input methods and Chinese calendars are supported, there is a new weather indicator,and users can quickly
 search across the most popular Chinese musicservices from the Dash. Future releases will include integration with Baidu maps and leading shopping service Taobao, payment processing for Chinese banks, and real-time train and flight information. TheUbuntu Kylin
 team is cooperating with WPS, the most popular office suite in China, and is creating photo editing and system management tools which could be incorporated into other flavours of Ubuntuworldwide.
“The release of Ubuntu Kylin brings the Chinese open source community into the global Ubuntu community,” said Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Ubuntu and Canonical. “With Ubuntu Kylin,China now has its own secure and stable desktop operating system,produced alongside
 Ubuntu's global community. Ubuntu combines proven technology with a mature ecosystem and strong OEM and ISV partners,and this initiative allows the Joint Lab to bring those strengths to China across the full range of platforms: desktop, server, cloud,tablet
 and phone.”(此话道出要害！)
