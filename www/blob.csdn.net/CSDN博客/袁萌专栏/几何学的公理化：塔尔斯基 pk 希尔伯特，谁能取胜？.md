1899年，希尔伯特为欧几里德《几何原本》写了一套公理系统，其中连续性公理组需要使用二阶逻辑。
自1926年开始，塔尔斯基琢磨欧氏几何，设法避免二阶逻辑，经过30多年的努力，在1959年，终于梦想成真。
请参见：“Hilbert's axiomsfor plane geometry number 16, and include Transitivity of Congruence and avariant of the Axiom of Pasch. The only notion from intuitive geometry invokedin the remarks to Tarski's axioms is triangle. (Versions B and C of the Axiomof Euclid refer to '"circle" and "angle," respectively.)Hilbert's axioms also require "ray," "angle," and thenotion of a triangle "including" an angle. In addition to betweennessand congruence, Hilbert's axioms require a primitive binary relation"on," linking a point and a line. The Axiom schema of Continuityplays a role similar to Hilbert's two axioms of Continuity. This schema isindispensable; Euclidean geometry in Tarski's (or equivalent) language cannotbe finitely axiomatized as a first-order theory. Hilbert's axioms do notconstitute a first-order theory because his continuity axioms requiresecond-order logic.”
总而言之：“The first fourgroups of axioms of Hilbert's axioms for plane geometry are Bi-interpretable with Tarski's axioms minus continuity.”
一阶逻辑状态 pk 二阶逻辑系统，谁胜谁负，不言自明。
