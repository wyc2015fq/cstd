**机器诗人诞生了**
**      5****月****12****日，谷歌首次发表一首机器诗人的作品，这标志着机器诗人的诞生。诗文的全文如下：**
**No.**
**he said.**
**“no,” he said.**
**“no,” i said.**
**“i know,” shesaid.**
**“thank you,” shesaid.**
**“come with me,”she said.**
**“talk to me,” shesaid.**
**“don’t worry aboutit,” she said.**
**it made me want to cry.**
**no one had seen him since.**
**it made me feel uneasy.**
**no one had seen him.**
**the thought made me smile.**
**the pain was unbearable.**
**the crowd was silent.**
**the man called out.**
**the old man said.**
**the man asked.**
**he was silent for a long moment.**
**he was silent for a moment.**
**it was quiet for a moment.**
**it was dark and cold.**
**there was a pause.**
**it was my turn.**
**there is no one else in the world.**
**there is no one else in sight.**
**they were the only ones who mattered.**
**they were the only ones left.**
**he had to be with me.**
**she had to be with him.**
**i had to do this.**
**i wanted to kill him.**
**i started to cry.**
**i turned to him.**
**    初看起来，该诗作有点儿后现代主义作品的味道儿，其中的意境需要琢磨。**
**    说明：机器歌手离我们不远了。**
