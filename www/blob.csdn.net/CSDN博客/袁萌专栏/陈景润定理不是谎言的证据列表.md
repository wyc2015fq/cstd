From a mathematical perspective, pseudo-randomness may be related to the complexity of certain number-theoretic properties[Cassaigne et al. 1999, Mauduit. 2002. Specifically, one may seek to define the unexpectedness of some properties of composition[Chen. 1978, Kak. 2014, Nicolas and Robin 1997that yield good randomness measure. In a recent paper, we showed that binary primes sequence can be used for computational hardening of pseudorandom sequences [Reddy and Kak 2016].

Another important achievement in this area is the well-known Chen's theorem[3]related to the twin prime conjecture.

... There are many papers devoted to the study of problems involving primes and almost primes. For example, in 1973 J. R. Chen[4]established that there exist infinitely many primes p such that p+2 ∈ P 2. In 2000 Tolev[12]proved that for every sufficiently large integer N ≡ 3 (mod 6) the equation (1) has a solution in prime numbers p 1 , p 2 , p 3 such that p 1 + 2 ∈ P 2 , p 2 + 2 ∈ P 5 , p 3 + 2 ∈ P 7. Thereafter this result was improved by Matom?ki and Shao[8], who showed that for every sufficiently large integer N ≡ 3 (mod 6) the equation (1) has a solution in prime numbers p 1 , p 2 , p 3 such that p 1 + 2, p 2 + 2, p 3 + 2 ∈ P 2. Recently Tolev[14]established that if N is sufficiently large, E > 0 is an arbitrarily large constant and 1 < c < 15 14 then the inequality[7]and Tolev[14]. ...

In this paper we prove that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of a prime and 2 times a product of at most two distinct odd primes. Together with Chen’s theorem and Ross’s observation, this shows every sufficiently large integer can be written as a sum of a prime and a square-free number with at most three prime divisors.

... Although the conjecture has resisted our efforts, there has been spectacular partial progress. One well known result is Chen's theorem [3] that there are infinitely many primes such that p + 2 has at most two prime factors. In a different direction, building on the work of Goldston, Pintz, and Y?ld?r?m [5], it has recently been shown by Zhang [11] that there are bounded gaps between consecutive primes infinitely often. ...

... It should be noted that the best known asymptotic result in this area is that of Chen [1], who proved that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and another number which is the product of at most two primes. Chen's result is, at present, the closest one seems to be able to get towards a proof of the Goldbach conjecture, which famously asserts that every even integer greater than two can be written as the sum of two primes. ...

... Using Vinogradov's method, Chudakov[2], Van der Corput[3], and Estermann[4]showed that " almost " all even numbers can be written as the sum of two primes. In 1973, Chen Jingrun using the methods of sieve theory showed that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a semiprime[6]. Considerable work has been done on Goldbach's weak conjecture that was finally proved in 2013 by Harald Helfgott[5]. His proof directly implies that every even number n ≥ 4 is the sum of at most four primes[7]. ...

... of randomness is also fundamental in cognitive science and decision theory[Aerts. 2009, Kak. 1996. From a mathematical perspective, pseudo-randomness may be related to the complexity of certain number-theoretic properties[Cassaigne et al. 1999, Mauduit. 2002. Specifically, one may seek to define the unexpectedness of some properties of composition[Chen. 1978, Kak. 2014, Nicolas and Robin 1997that yield good randomness measure. In a recent paper, we showed that binary primes sequence can be used for computational hardening of pseudorandom sequences [Reddy and Kak 2016]. Here we go beyond that idea and generate pseudorandom sequences by folding the binary primes sequences using p columns. Thi ...

Ziegler (see[6],[7],[8]) and we refer the reader to[6, Theorem 1.8]for the precise statement. Another important achievement in this area is the well-known Chen's theorem[3]related to the twin prime conjecture. The theorem asserts that the equation x 1 ? x 2 = 2 has infinitely many solutions (? 1 , p 2 ) where ? 1 has at most two prime factors and p 2 is prime. ...

陈景润工作的影响：
... There are many papers devoted to the study of problems involving primes and almost primes. For example, in 1973 J. R. Chen[4]established that there exist infinitely many primes p such that p+2 ∈ P 2. In 2000 Tolev[12]proved that for every sufficiently large integer N ≡ 3 (mod 6) the equation (1) has a solution in prime numbers p 1 , p 2 , p 3 such that p 1 + 2 ∈ P 2 , p 2 + 2 ∈ P 5 , p 3 + 2 ∈ P 7. Thereafter this result was improved by Matom?ki and Shao[8], who showed that for every sufficiently large integer N ≡ 3 (mod 6) the equation (1) has a solution in prime numbers p 1 , p 2 , p 3 such that p 1 + 2, p 2 + 2, p 3 + 2 ∈ P 2. Recently Tolev[14]established that if N is sufficiently large, E > 0 is an arbitrarily large constant and 1 < c < 15 14 then the inequality[7]and Tolev[14]. ...

In this paper we prove that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of a prime and 2 times a product of at most two distinct odd primes. Together with Chen’s theorem and Ross’s observation, this shows every sufficiently large integer can be written as a sum of a prime and a square-free number with at most three prime divisors.
