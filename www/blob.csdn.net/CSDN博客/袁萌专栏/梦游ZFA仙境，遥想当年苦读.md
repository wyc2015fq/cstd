附：ZFC公理体系：
There are many equivalentformulations of the ZFC axioms; for a discussion of this see [Fraenkel,Bar-Hillel & Lévy 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#CITEREFFraenkelBar-HillelL.C3.A9vy1973). The following parKunen ticular axiom set is from [(1980)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#CITEREFKunen1980)
articular 
axiom set is from [Kunen(1980)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#CITEREFKunen1980). The axioms per se are expressed in the symbolism of [firstorder logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_order_logic). The associated English prose is only intended to aid theintuition.
All formulations of ZFC implythat at least one set exists. Kunen includes an axiom that directly asserts theexistence of a set, in addition to the axioms given below (although he notesthat he does so only “for emphasis”).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#cite_note-3) Itsomission here can be justified in two ways. First, in the standard semantics offirst-order logic in which ZFC is typically formalized, the [domain of discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse) must be nonempty. Hence, itis a logical theorem of first-order logic that something exists — usuallyexpressed as the assertion that something is identica
axiom that directly asserts the existence of a set,in addition to the axioms given below (although he notes that he does so only“for emphasis”).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#cite_note-3) Itsomission here can be justified in two ways. First, in the standard semantics offirst-order logic in which ZFC is typically formalized, the [domain of discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse) must be nonempty. Hence, itis a logical theorem of first-order logic that something exists — usuallyexpressed as the assertion that something is identical to itself, ∃x(x=x). Consequently, it is a theorem of everyfirst-order theory that something exists. However, as noted above, because inthe intended semantics of ZFC there are only sets, the interpretation of thislogical theorem in the context of ZFC is that some *set* exists. Hence,there is no need for a separate axiom asserting that a set exists. Second,however, even if ZFC is formulated in so-called [free logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_logic),in which it is not provable from logic alone that something exists, the axiomof infinity (below) asserts that an *infinite* set exists. This impliesthat *a* set exists and so, once again, it is superfluous to include anaxiom asserting as much.
**1. Axiom ofextensionality[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=3)]**
*Mainarticle: [Axiom of extensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality)*
Two sets are equal (are the sameset) if they have the same elements.
∀ x ∀ y [ ∀ z ( z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y ) ⇒ x = y ] . 
{\displaystyle \forall x\forally[\forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow x=y].} 
The converse of this axiomfollows from the substitution property of [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics)). If the background logic does notinclude equality "=", *x*=*y* may be defined as anabbreviation for the following formula:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#cite_note-4)
∀ z [ z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y ] ∧ ∀ w [ x ∈ w ⇔ y ∈ w ] . {\displaystyle \forall z[z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y]\land\forall w[x\in w\Leftrightarrow y\in w].} 
In this case, the axiom ofextensionality can be reformulated as
∀ x ∀ y [ ∀ z ( z ∈ x ⇔ z ∈ y ) ⇒∀ w ( x ∈ w ⇔ y ∈ w ) ] , {\displaystyle \forall x\forall y[\forall z(z\inx\Leftrightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow \forall w(x\in w\Leftrightarrow y\in w)],} 
which says that if *x* and *y*have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#cite_note-5)
**2. Axiom ofregularity (also called the Axiom of foundation)[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=4)]**
*Mainarticle: [Axiom of regularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_regularity)*
Every non-empty set *x*contains a member *y* such that *x* and *y* are [disjointsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets).
∀ x [ ∃ a ( a ∈ x ) ⇒∃ y ( y ∈ x ∧ ¬ ∃ z ( z ∈ y ∧ z ∈ x ) ) ] 
. {\displaystyle \forall x[\existsa(a\in x)\Rightarrow \exists y(y\in x\land \lnot \exists z(z\in y\land z\inx))].} [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#cite_note-6)
This implies, for example, thatno set is an element of itself and that every set has an [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number)[rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(set_theory)).
**3. Axiomschema of specification (also called the axiom schema of separation or ofrestricted comprehension)[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=5)]**
*Mainarticle: [Axiom schema of specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_specification)*
Subsets are commonly constructedusing [set builder notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_builder_notation). For example, the evenintegers can be constructed as the subset of the integers Z{\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } satisfyingthe [congruence modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_modulo_n) predicate x ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) {\displaystyle x\equiv 0{\pmod {2}}} :
{ x ∈ Z : x ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) } . 
{\displaystyle \{x\in \mathbb {Z}:x\equiv 0{\pmod {2}}\}.} 
In general, the subset of a set *z*obeying a formula ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } (*x*)with one free variable *x* may be written as:
{ x ∈ z : ϕ ( x ) } . {\displaystyle \{x\inz:\phi (x)\}.} 
The axiom schema of specificationstates that this subset always exists (it is an [axiom *schema*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema)because there is one axiom for each ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } ). Formally,let ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } be anyformula in the language of ZFC with all free variables among x , z , w 1 , … , w n {\displaystyle x,z,w_{1},\ldots,w_{n}} (*y* is*not* free in ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } ). Then:
∀ z ∀ w 1 ∀ w 2 … ∀ w n ∃ y ∀ x [ x ∈ y ⇔ ( x ∈ z ∧ ϕ ) ] . {\displaystyle \forall z\forall w_{1}\forallw_{2}\ldots \forall w_{n}\exists y\forall x[x\in y\Leftrightarrow (x\in z\land\phi )].} 
Note that the axiom schema ofspecification can only construct subsets, and does not allow the constructionof sets of the more general form:
{ x : ϕ ( x ) } . {\displaystyle \{x:\phi(x)\}.} 
This restriction is necessary toavoid [Russell's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox) and its variants that accompanynaive set theory with [unrestricted comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_comprehension).
In some other axiomatizations ofZF, this axiom is redundant in that it follows from the [axiom schema of replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_replacement) and the [axiom of the empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_the_empty_set).
On the other hand, the axiom ofspecification can be used to prove the existence of the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set),denoted ∅{\displaystyle \varnothing } , once atleast one set is known to exist (see above). One way to do this is to use aproperty ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } which no sethas. For example, if *w* is any existing set, the empty set can beconstructed as
∅ = { u∈ w ∣ ( u ∈ u ) ∧ ¬ ( u ∈ u ) } {\displaystyle \varnothing =\{u\in w\mid (u\inu)\land \lnot (u\in u)\}} .
Thus the [axiom of the empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_the_empty_set) is implied by thenine axioms presented here. The axiom of extensionality implies the empty setis unique (does not depend on *w*). It is common to make a [definitional extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitional_extension) that adds the symbol ∅ {\displaystyle\varnothing } to thelanguage of ZFC.
**4. Axiom ofpairing[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=6)]**
*Mainarticle: [Axiom of pairing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_pairing)*
If *x* and *y* aresets, then there exists a set which contains *x* and *y* as elements.
∀ x ∀ y ∃ z ( x ∈ z ∧ y ∈ z ) . 
{\displaystyle \forall x\forally\exists z(x\in z\land y\in z).} 
The axiom schema of specificationmust be used to reduce this to a set with exactly these two elements. The axiomof pairing is part of Z, but is redundant in ZF because it follows from theaxiom schema of replacement, if we are given a set with at least two elements.The existence of a set with at least two elements is assured by either the [axiomof infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity), or by the axiom schema of specification and the [axiom of the power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_the_power_set) applied twice to anyset.
**5. Axiom ofunion[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=7)]**
*Mainarticle: [Axiom of union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_union)*
The union over the elements of aset exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set { { 1 , 2 } , { 2 , 3 } } {\displaystyle\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}} is { 1 , 2 , 3 } {\displaystyle \{1,2,3\}} .
Formally, the axiom of unionstates that for any set of sets F {\displaystyle{\mathcal {F}}} there is aset A {\displaystyle A} containingevery element that is a member of some member of F{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} :
∀ F ∃ A ∀ Y ∀ x [ (x ∈ Y ∧ Y ∈ F ) ⇒ x ∈ A ] . 
{\displaystyle \forall {\mathcal{F}}\,\exists A\,\forall Y\,\forall x[(x\in Y\land Y\in {\mathcal{F}})\Rightarrow x\in A].} 
While this doesn't directlyassert the existence of ∪ F {\displaystyle \cup{\mathcal {F}}} , it can beconstructed from A {\displaystyle A} in the aboveusing the axiom schema of specification:
∪ F := { x ∈ A : ∃ Y ( x ∈ Y ∧ Y ∈ F ) } {\displaystyle\cup {\mathcal {F}}:=\{x\in A:\exists Y(x\in Y\land Y\in {\mathcal {F}})\}} 
[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Codomain2_A_B.SVG)
Axiom schemaof replacement: the image of the domain set *A* under the definablefunction *f* (i.e. the range of *f*) falls inside a set *B*.
**6. Axiomschema of replacement[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=8)]**
*Mainarticle: [Axiom schema of replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_replacement)*
The axiom schema of replacementasserts that the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics)) of a set under any definable functionwill also fall inside a set.
Formally, let ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } be any [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula) in the language of ZFC whose [freevariables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variable) are among x , y , A , w 1 , … , wn {\displaystyle x,y,A,w_{1},\dotsc ,w_{n}} , so that inparticular B {\displaystyle B} is not freein ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } . Then:
∀ A ∀ w 1 ∀ w 2 … ∀ w n [ ∀ x ( x ∈ A ⇒∃ ! y ϕ ) ⇒∃ B  ∀ x ( x ∈ A ⇒∃ y ( y ∈ B ∧ ϕ ) ) ] . 
{\displaystyle \forall A\forallw_{1}\forall w_{2}\ldots \forall w_{n}{\bigl [}\forall x(x\in A\Rightarrow\exists !y\,\phi )\Rightarrow \exists B\ \forall x{\bigl (}x\in A\Rightarrow\exists y(y\in B\land \phi ){\bigr )}{\bigr ]}.} 
In other words, if the relation ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } represents adefinable function f {\displaystyle f} , A {\displaystyle A} representsits [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function), and f ( x ){\displaystyle f(x)} is a set forevery x ∈ A {\displaystyle x\in A} , then the [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(mathematics)) of f{\displaystyle f} is a subsetof some set B {\displaystyle B} . The formstated here, in which B {\displaystyle B} may belarger than strictly necessary, is sometimes called the [axiom schema of collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_replacement#Axiom_schema_of_collection).
**7. Axiom ofinfinity[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=9)]**
*Mainarticle: [Axiom of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity)*
Let S ( w ){\displaystyle S(w)} abbreviate w ∪ { w } {\displaystyle w\cup \{w\}} , where w {\displaystyle w} is some set.(We can see that { w } {\displaystyle \{w\}} is a validset by applying the Axiom of Pairing with x = y =w {\displaystyle x=y=w} so that theset z {\displaystyle z} is { w } {\displaystyle \{w\}} ). Thenthere exists a set *X* such that the empty set ∅ {\displaystyle\varnothing } is a memberof *X* and, whenever a set *y* is a member of *X*, then S ( y ) {\displaystyle S(y)} is also amember of *X*.
∃ X [ ∅ ∈ X ∧ ∀ y ( y ∈ X ⇒ S ( y ) ∈ X ) ] . 
{\displaystyle \existsX\left[\varnothing \in X\land \forall y(y\in X\Rightarrow S(y)\in X)\right].} 
More colloquially, there exists aset *X* having infinitely many members. (It must be established, however,that these members are all different, because if two elements are the same, thesequence will loop around in a finite cycle of sets. The axiom of regularityprevents this from happening.) The minimal set *X* satisfying the axiom ofinfinity is the [von Neumann ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_ordinal) ω, which can also bethought of as the set of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_numbers)N{\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } .
**8. Axiom ofpower set[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=10)]**
*Mainarticle: [Axiom of power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_power_set)*
By definition a set *z* is a[subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of a set*x* if and only if every element of *z* is also an element of *x*:
( z ⊆ x ) ⇔ ( ∀ q ( q ∈ z ⇒ q ∈ x ) ) . 
{\displaystyle (z\subseteqx)\Leftrightarrow (\forall q(q\in z\Rightarrow q\in x)).} 
The Axiom of Power Set statesthat for any set *x*, there is a set *y* that contains every subsetof *x*:
∀ x ∃ y ∀ z [ z ⊆ x ⇒ z ∈ y ] . {\displaystyle \forall x\exists y\forall z[z\subseteqx\Rightarrow z\in y].} 
The axiom schema of specificationis then used to define the [power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set)*P(x)* as the subset of such a *y*containing the subsets of *x* exactly:
P ( x ) = { z ∈ y : z ⊆ x }{\displaystyle P(x)=\{z\in y:z\subseteq x\}} 
Axioms **1–8** define ZF.Alternative forms of these axioms are often encountered, some of which arelisted in [Jech(2003)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#CITEREFJech2003). Some ZF axiomatizations include an axiom asserting that the [empty set exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_empty_set). The axioms of pairing, union,replacement, and power set are often stated so that the members of the set *x*whose existence is being asserted are just those sets which the axiom asserts *x*must contain.
The following axiom is added toturn ZF into ZFC:
**9.Well-ordering theorem[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=11)]**
*Mainarticle: [Well-ordering theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_theorem)*
For any set *X*, there is a [binaryrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation)*R* which [well-orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellordering)*X*. This means *R* is a [linearorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_order) on *X* such that every nonempty [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of *X*has a member which is minimal under *R*.
∀ X ∃ R ( Rwell-orders X ) . 
{\displaystyle \forall X\existsR(R\;{\mbox{well-orders}}\;X).} 
Given axioms **1–8**, thereare many statements provably equivalent to axiom **9**, the best known ofwhich is the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice) (AC), which goes as follows. Let *X*be a set whose members are all non-empty. Then there exists a function *f*from *X* to the union of the members of *X*, called a "[choicefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_function)", such that for all *Y*∈*X* one has *f*(*Y*)∈*Y*. Since the existence of a choice function when *X* is a [finite set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set)is easily proved from axioms **1–8**, AC only matters for certain [infinitesets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set). AC is characterized as [nonconstructive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_mathematics) because it asserts theexistence of a choice set but says nothing about how the choice set is to be"constructed." Much research has sought to characterize thedefinability (or lack thereof) of certain sets whose existence AC asserts.
**Motivationvia the cumulative hierarchy[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=12)]**
One motivation for the ZFC axiomsis the [cumulative hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_hierarchy) of sets introduced by [Johnvon Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#cite_note-7) In thisviewpoint, the universe of set theory is built up in stages, with one stage foreach [ordinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number). At stage 0 there are no sets yet. Ateach following stage, a set is added to the universe if all of its elementshave been added at previous stages. Thus the empty set is added at stage 1, andthe set containing the empty set is added at stage 2.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#cite_note-8) Thecollection of all sets that are obtained in this way, over all the stages, isknown as V. The sets in V can be arranged into a hierarchy by assigning to eachset the first stage at which that set was added to V.
It is provable that a set is in Vif and only if the set is [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_set) and [well-founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_set);and provable that V satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, if the class of ordinalshas appropriate reflection properties. For example, suppose that a set *x*is added at stage α, which means that every element of *x* was added at astage earlier than α. Then every subset of *x* is also added at stage α,because all elements of any subset of *x* were also added before stage α.This means that any subset of *x* which the axiom of separation canconstruct is added at stage α, and that the powerset of *x* will be addedat the next stage after α. For a complete argument that V satisfies ZFC see [Shoenfield(1977)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#CITEREFShoenfield1977).
The picture of the universe ofsets stratified into the cumulative hierarchy is characteristic of ZFC andrelated axiomatic set theories such as [Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel settheory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory) (often called NBG) and [Morse–Kelley set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse%E2%80%93Kelley_set_theory). The cumulativehierarchy is not compatible with other set theories such as [NewFoundations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Foundations).
It is possible to change thedefinition of *V* so that at each stage, instead of adding all the subsetsof the union of the previous stages, subsets are only added if they aredefinable in a certain sense. This results in a more "narrow"hierarchy which gives the [constructible universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_universe)*L*, which alsosatisfies all the axioms of ZFC, including the axiom of choice. It isindependent from the ZFC axioms whether *V* = *L*. Althoughthe structure of *L* is more regular and well behaved than that of *V*,few mathematicians argue that *V* = *L* should be added toZFC as an additional axiom.
**Metamathematics[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=13)]**
The axiom schemata of replacementand separation each contain infinitely many instances. [Montague(1961)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#CITEREFMontague1961) included a result first proved in his 1957 Ph.D. thesis: if ZFC isconsistent, it is impossible to axiomatize ZFC using only finitely many axioms.On the other hand, [Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel settheory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory) (NBG) can be finitely axiomatized. The ontology of NBG includes [proper classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(set_theory)) as well as sets; a set is anyclass that can be a member of another class. NBG and ZFC are equivalent settheories in the sense that any [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem) not mentioning classes and provable in one theory canbe proved in the other.
[Gödel's second incompletenesstheorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_second_incompleteness_theorem) says that a recursively axiomatizable system that can interpret [Robinson arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic) can prove its ownconsistency only if it is inconsistent. Moreover, Robinson arithmetic can beinterpreted in [general set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_set_theory), a small fragment of ZFC.Hence the [consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_proof) of ZFC cannot be proved within ZFCitself (unless it is actually inconsistent). Thus, to the extent that ZFC isidentified with ordinary mathematics, the consistency of ZFC cannot bedemonstrated in ordinary mathematics. The consistency of ZFC does follow fromthe existence of a weakly [inaccessible cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_cardinal), which is unprovable inZFC if ZFC is consistent. Nevertheless, it is deemed unlikely that ZFC harborsan unsuspected contradiction; it is widely believed that if ZFC wereinconsistent, that fact would have been uncovered by now. This much is certain— ZFC is immune to the classic paradoxes of [naiveset theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory): [Russell's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox), the [Burali-Forti paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burali-Forti_paradox), and [Cantor'sparadox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_paradox).
[Abian& LaMacchia (1978)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#CITEREFAbianLaMacchia1978) studied a [subtheory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtheory) ofZFC consisting of the axioms of extensionality, union, powerset, replacement,and choice. Using [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory), they proved this subtheory consistent, andproved that each of the axioms of extensionality, replacement, and power set isindependent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory. If this subtheoryis augmented with the axiom of infinity, each of the axioms of union, choice,and infinity is independent of the five remaining axioms. Because there are [non-well-founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-well-founded_set_theory) models that satisfyeach axiom of ZFC except the axiom of regularity, that axiom is independent ofthe other ZFC axioms.
If consistent, ZFC cannot provethe existence of the [inaccessible cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_cardinal) that [categorytheory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) requires. Huge sets of this nature are possible if ZF is augmentedwith [Tarski's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%E2%80%93Grothendieck_set_theory).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#cite_note-9) Assumingthat axiom turns the axioms of [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity),[power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_power_set), and [choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice)(**7**−**9** above) into theorems.
**Independence[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory&action=edit&section=14)]**
Many important statements are [independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_independence) of ZFC (see [list of statements undecidable inZFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_in_ZFC)). The independence is usually proved by [forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)), whereby it is shown that everycountable transitive [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory) of ZFC (sometimes augmented with [large cardinal axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cardinal_axiom)) can be expanded tosatisfy the statement in question. A different expansion is then shown tosatisfy the negation of the statement. An independence proof by forcingautomatically proves independence from arithmetical statements, other concretestatements, and large cardinal axioms. Some statements independent of ZFC canbe proven to hold in particular [innermodels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_model), such as in the [constructible universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_universe). However, somestatements that are true about constructible sets are not consistent withhypothesized large cardinal axioms.
Forcing proves that the followingstatements are independent of ZFC:
- [Continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis)
- [Diamond principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamondsuit)
- [Suslin hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suslin%27s_problem)
- [Martin's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin%27s_axiom) (which is not a ZFC axiom)
- [Axiom of Constructibility (V=L)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_constructibility)     (which is also not a ZFC axiom).
Remarks:
- The consistency of V=L is provable by [inner     models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_model) but not forcing: every model of ZF can be trimmed to become a     model of ZFC + V=L.
- The Diamond Principle implies the Continuum     Hypothesis and the negation of the Suslin Hypothesis.
- Martin's axiom plus the negation of the Continuum     Hypothesis implies the Suslin Hypothesis.
- The [constructible universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_universe) satisfies the [Generalized Continuum Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Continuum_Hypothesis),     the Diamond Principle, Martin's Axiom and the Kurepa Hypothesis.
- The failure of the [Kurepa     hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurepa_tree) is equiconsistent with the existence of a [strongly inaccessible cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_inaccessible_cardinal).
