1.5 INFINITESIMAL, FINITE, AND INFINITE NUMBERS
Let us summarize our intuitive description of the hyperreal numbers from Section 1.4.
The real line is a subset of the hyperreal line; that is, each
 real number belongs to the set of hyperreal numbers. Surrounding each real number
*r*,we introduce a collection of hyperreal numbers infinitely close to*r*.The hyperreal
 numbers infinitely close to zero are called infinitesimals. The reciprocals of nonzero infinitesimals are infinite hyperreal numbers. The collection of all hyperreal numbers satisfies the same algebraic laws as the real numbers. In this section we describe
 the hyperreal numbers more precisely and develop a facility for computation with them.
Thisentire calculus course is developed from three basic principlesrelating the real and hyperreal numbers:
 the Extension Principle, theTransfer Principle, and the Standard Part Principle. The first twoprinciples are presented in this section, and the third principle isin the next section.
Webegin with the Extension Principle, which gives us new numbers
 calledhyperreal numbers and extends all real functions to these numbers.The Extension Principle will deal with hyperreal functions as well asreal functions. Our discussion of real functions in Section 1.2 canreadily be carried over to hyperreal functions.
 Recall that for eachreal number *a*,a real function*f*ofone variable either associates another real number
*b=f(a)*oris undefined. Now, for each hyperreal number
*H*,a hyperreal function
*F*ofone variable either associates another hyperreal number
*K=F(H)*oris undefined. For each pair of hyperreal numbers
*H*and*J,*ahyperreal function
*G *oftwo variables either associates another hyperreal number
*K=G(H,J)*oris undefined. Hyperreal functions of three or more variables aredefined in a similar way.
1.THE EXTENSION
 PRINCIPLE
*(a) Thereal numbers form a subset of the hyperreal numbers, and the orderrelation x<y for*
*the realnumbers is a subset of the order relation for the hyperreal numbers.*
(b) *Thereis a hyperreal number that is greater than zero but less than everypositive real *
*number.*
(c) *Forevery real function f of one or more variables we are given acorresponding hyperreal *
*function f*of the same number of variables. f* is called the natural extensionof f.*
Part(a) of the Extension Principle says that the real line is a part ofthe hyperreal line. To explain part (b)
 of the Extension Principle,we give a careful definition of an infinitesimal.
DEFINITION
*Ahyperreal number b is said to be:*
*Positive infinitesimalif b is positive but less than every positive real number, negativeinfinitesimal if b is negative but greater than every negative realnumber.*
*Infinitesimal ifb is either positive infinitesimal, negative infinitesimal, or zero.*
Withthis definition, part (b) of the Extension Principle says that thereis at least one positive infinitesimal.
 We shall see later that thereare infinitely many positive infinitesimals. A positive infinitesimalis a hyperreal number but cannot be a real number, so part (b)ensures that there are hyperreal numbers that are not real numbers.
Part(c) of the Extension Principle allows us to apply real functions
 tohyperreal numbers. Since the addition function +is a real function oftwo variables, its natural extension +* is a hyperreal function oftwo variables. If
*x *and*y*arehyperreal numbers, the sum of
*x*and*y*isthe number
*x+*y*formedby using the natural extension of +. Similarly, the product of*x*and*y*isthe number*x*.**y*formedby using the natural extension of the product function ·. To makethings easier to read, we shall drop the asterisks and write simply
*x+y*and*x*·*y*forthe
 sum and product of two hyperreal numbers *x *and*y.*Usingthe natural extensions of the sum and product functions, we will beable to develop algebra for hyperreal numbers. Part (c) of theExtension Principle also allows us to work with
 expressions such ascos(*x*)or sin(*x*+cos(*y*)),which
 involve one or more real functions. We call such expressions*real expressions*.These expressions can be used even when
*x *and*y*arehyperreal numbers instead of real numbers. For example, when
*x*and*y*arehyperreal, sin(*x*+cos(*y*))will
 mean sin*(*x*+cos*(*y*)),where sin* and cos* are the natural extensions of sin and
 cos. Theasterisks are dropped as before.
Wenow state the Transfer Principle, which allows us to carry outcomputations with the hyperreal numbers in the
 same way as we do forreal numbers. Intuitively, the Transfer Principle says that thenatural extension of each real function has the same properties asthe original function.
‖.TRANSFER  PRINCIPLE
*Everyreal statement that holds for one or more particular real functionsholds for the *
*hyperreal naturalextensions of these functions.*
Hereare seven examples that illustrate what we mean by
*areal statement*.In general, by a real statement we mean a combination of equations orinequalities about real expressions, and statements specifyingwhether a real expression
 is defined or undefined. A real statementwill involve real variables and particular real functions.
(1)Closurelaw
 for addition: for any *x*and*y*,the sum
*x+y*isdefined.
*(2)*Commutativelaw
 for addition : *x+y=y+x*
(3)Arule
 for order : If 0<*x*<*y*,then 0<1/*y*<1/*x*.
(4)Divisionby
 zero is never allowed : *x*/0is undefined.
(5)Analgebraic
 identity : (*x-y*)²=*x*²-2*xy+y*².
(6)Atrigonometric
 identity : sin²*x*+cos²*x*=1.
(7)Arule
 for logarithms : If *x*>0and
*y*>0,then log10(*xy*)= log10*x*+log10*y*.
Eachexample has two variables,
*x *and*y,*andholds true whenever*x*and*y*arereal numbers. The Transfer Principle tells us that each example alsoholds whenever
*x*and*y*arehyperreal numbers. For instance, by Example (4),
*x*/0is undefined, even for hyperreal
*x*.By Example (6),
sin²*x*+cos
 ²*x *=1,even 1or hyperreal
*x*.
Noticethat the first five examples involve only the sum, difference,product, and quotient functions. However,
 the last two examples arereal statements involving the transcendental functions sin, cos, andlog10. The Transfer Principle extends all the familiar rules oftrigonometry, exponents, and logarithms to the hyperreal numbers.
Incalculus we frequently make a computation involving one or moreunknown real numbers. The Transfer Principle
 allows us to compute inexactly the same way with hyperreal numbers. It “transfers”factsabout
 the real numbers to facts about the hyperreal numbers. Inparticular, the Transfer Principle implies that a real function andits natural extension always give the same value when applied to areal number. This is why we are usually able to drop the asteriskswhen
 computing with hyperreal numbers.
Areal statement is often used to define a new real function from oldreal functions. By the Transfer Principle, whenever a real statementdefines a real function, the same real
 statement also defines thehyperreal natural extension function. Here are three more examples.
*(8)*Thesquare root
 function is defined by the real statement*y*=____if,and
 only if, *y*²=*x*and*y*≥0.
(9)Theabsolute
 value function is defined by the real statement *y=|x|*if,and only if,
*y*=____.
(10)Thecommon
 logarithm function is defined by the real statement
*y*=log10*x*if,and only if, 10*y*=*x.*
Ineach case, the hyperreal natural extension is the function defined bythe given real statement when
*x*and*y*varyover the hyperreal numbers. For example, the hyperreal naturalextension of the square function
___*,is defined by Example (8) when x and y are hyperreal.
Animportant use of the Transfer Principle is to carry out computationswith infinitesimal. For example, a computation
 with infinitesimalswas used in the slope calculation in Section 1.4. The ExtensionPrinciple tells us that there is at least one positive infinitesimalhyperreal number, say
*ε*.Starting from
*ε*,we can use the Transfer Principle to construct infinitely many otherpositive infinitesimals. For example,
*ε*²isa positive infinitesimal that is smaller than
*ε, 0<**ε*²<*ε.*(thisfollows from the
 Transfer Principle because *0<**x*²<*x*forall real
*x*between0 and 1.) Here are several positive infinitesimal, listed inincreasing order:
______________________
Wecan also construct negative infinitesimals, such as -*εand ε*²,and
 other hyperreal numbers such as 1+_____,(10-
*ε*)²,and 1/*ε*.
Weshall now give a list of rules for deciding whether a given hyperrealnumber is infinitesimal, finite, or infinite. All these rules followfrom the Transfer Principle alone. First,
 look at Figure 1.5.1,illustrating the hyperreal line.

DEFINITION
*Ahyperreal number b is said to be:*
*finite ifb is between two real numbers.*
*positive infiniteif b is greater than every real number.*
*negative infiniteif b is less than every real number.*
Noticethat each infinitesimal number is finite. Before going through thewhole list of rules, let us take a close look at two of them.
*Ifε is infinitesimal and a is finite, then the product a·εis infinitesimal. For example,**_______**_are infinitesimal. This can be seen intuitively from Figure 1.5.2; aninfinitely thin rectangle of length a has infinitesimal area.*
*Ifε is positive infinitesimal, then 1/ε is positiveinfinite. From experience we know that reciprocals of small numbersare large, so we intuitively expect 1/ε to be positiveinfinite. We can use the Transfer Principle to prove 1/ε ispositive infinite. Let r be any positive real number. Since εis positive infinitesimal, 0<ε<1/r. Applying the TransferPrinciple, 1/ε >r >0. Therefore, 1/ε ispositive infinite.*

RULESFOR INFINITESIMAL, FINITE, AND INFINITE NUMBERS
Assumethat
*ε, δ are infinitesimal; b, care hyperreal numbers that are finite but not infinitesimal; and H, Kare infinite hyperreal numbers.*
*(i)  Real numbers:*
*The onlyinfinitesimal real number is*0*.*
*Every realnumber is finite.*
*(ii)  Negatives:*
*-εis infinitesimal.*
*-b isfinite but not infinitesimal.*
*-H isinfinite.*
*(iii) Reciprocals:*
*Ifε* ≠
*0, *1*/εis infinite.*
*1/bis finite but not infinitesimal.*
*1/His infinitesimal.*
*(iv)Sums:*
*ε+δ is infinitesimal.*
*b+ ε is finite but not infinitesimal.*
*b+ c is finite (possible infinitesimal).*
*H+ε and  H + b are infinite.*
*(v)Products:*
*δ·εand b·ε are infinitesimal.*
*b·c isfinite but not infinitesimal.*
*H·b andH·K are infinite.*
*(vi)Quotients:*
*ε/b,ε/H, and b/ H are infinitesimal.*
*b/cis finite but not infinitesimal.*
*b/ε, H/ε , and H/b are infinite, provided that ε≠0.*
*(vii)Roots:*
*Ifε >*0*,**____**is infinitesimal.*
*Ifb >0,**____ **isinfinitesimal but not infinitesimal.*
*IfH >0,**____ **is infinite.*
Noticethat we have given no rule for the following combinations:
*ε/δ*,the quotient
 of two infinitesimals.
*H/K*,the quotient
 of two infinite numbers.
*H**ε*,the
 product of an infinite number and an infinitesimal.
*H+ K*,the
 sum of two infinite numbers.
Eachof these can be either infinitesimal, finite but not infinitesimal,or
 infinite, depending on what *ε,δ*,*H,*and*K*are.For this reason, they are called
*indeterminateforms.*
Hereare three very different quotients of infinitesimals.
___isinfinitesimal
 (equal to *ε*).
______isfinite
 but not infinitesimal (equal to 1).
______isinfinite
 ( equal to ___).
Table1.5.1 on the following page shows the three possibilities for eachindeterminate form. Here are some examples
 which show how to use ourrules.
EXAMPLE1Consider(*b*-3*ε*)/(*c*+2*δ*).*ε*isinfinitesimal, so -3*ε*isinfinitesimal and
*b-*3*ε*isfinite but not infinitesimal. Similarly,
*c+*2*δ*isfinite but not infinitesimal. Therefore
 the quotient
*b-*3*ε*
*c+*2*δ*
isfinite but not infinitesimal.
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/52/4c52d6110a98192664532bd84c6457b2.files/file0059.png)

Thenext three examples are quotients of infinitesimals.
EXAMPLE2  The quotient
5ε4-8ε3+ε2
3ε
isinfinitesimal, provided  ε≠0.
Thegiven number is equal to
(1)_____________________
We seein turn that
______________areinfinitesimal;
 hence the sum(1) is infinitesimal.
EXAMPLE3
Ifε≠0,the quotient
3*ε*3+*ε*2-6*ε*
2*ε*2+*ε*
isfinite but not infinitesimal.
Cancellingan
*ε*fromnumerator and denominator, we get
(2)
3*ε*3+*ε*-6
2*ε*+1
Since3*ε*2+*ε*isinfinitesimal
 while -6 is finite but not infinitesimal, the numerator
3*ε*3+*ε*-6
isfinite but not infinitesimal. Similarly, the denominator 2*ε*+1,
 and hence 
thequotient(2) is finite but not infinitesimal.
EXAMPLE4  If
*ε*≠0,the quotient
*ε*4_
*ε*3+2*ε*2
5*ε*4+*ε*3
isinfinite.
Wefirst note that the denominator
5*ε*4+*ε*3isnot
 zero because it can be written as a product of nonzero factors,
*5ε4**+**ε3*=*ε·ε·ε·(5ε+1).*
Whenwe cancel
*ε2*fromthe numerator and denominator we get
*ε*2_
*ε*+2
5*ε*2+*ε*
Wesee in turn that :
*ε*2_
*ε*+2isfinite
 but not infinitesimal,
5*ε*2+*ε*isinfinitesimal.,
*ε*2_
*ε*+2
5*ε*2+*ε*isinfinite.
EXAMPLE5
__________isfinite
 but not infinitesimal.
Inthis example the trick is to multiply both numerator and denominatorby
 1/H2.We get
2+1/*H*
1-1/*H*+2/*H*2
Now1/*H*and1/*H*2areinfinitesimal.
 Therefore both the numerator and denominator arefinite but not infinitesimal, and so is the quotient.
Inthe next theorem we list facts about the ordering of the hyperreals.
THEOREM1
(i)*Every hyperreal number which is between twoinfinitesimal is infinitesimal.*
*(ii)Every hyperreal number which is between two finite hyperreal numbersis finite.*
*(iii)Every hyperreal number which is greater than some positive infinitenumber is positive infinite.*
*(iv)Every hyperreal number which is less than some negative infinitenumber is negative infinite.*
Allthe proofs are easy. We prove (iii), which is especially useful.Assume
*H*ispositive infinite and
*H< K*.Then for any real number
*r, r<H<K. *Therefore,*r< K*and*K*ispositive infinite.
EXAMPLE6 If*H *and*K*arepositive infinite hyperreal numbers, then
*H+K *ispositive infinite. 
This istrue because
*H+K*isgreater than
*H*.
Ourlast example concerns square roots.
EXAMPLE7If*H*ispositive infinite then, surprisingly,
____________________
is infinitesimal.
This isshown using an algebraic trick.

Thenumbers
*H*+1,
*H*-1,and their square roots are positive infinite, and thus the sum_______ispositive
 infinite. Therefore the quotient
