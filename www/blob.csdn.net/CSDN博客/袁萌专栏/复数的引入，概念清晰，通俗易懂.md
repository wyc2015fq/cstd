在数学发展史上，柯西是第一个把复数分为两个部分的数学家。J.Keisler精心撰写的微积分学教材，在二阶微分方程求解章节中，实时地引入复数及其运算法则，通俗易懂、
大家相信，00后大学生阅读这种英文原文不应该感到困难。
This sectionbegins with a review of the complex numbers. Complex numbers are useful in thesolution of second order differential equations. The starting point is theimaginary number i, which is the square root of -1. The complex number systemis an extension of the real number system that is formed by adding the number iand keeping the usual rules for sums and products. The set of complex numbers,or complex plane, is the set of all numbers of the form
Z =-X + iy
where x and y are real numbers. The number x is called the real part ofz, and y is called the imaginary part of z. A complex number z can berepresented by a point in the plane, with the real part drawn on the horizontalaxis and the imaginary part on the vertical axis, as in Figure 14.5.1. The sumof two complex numbers is computed in the same way as the sum of two vectors,
Figure 14.5.1
(a+ ib) + (c + id) =(a+ c)+ i(b +d).
iy... X + iy
The product oftwo complex numbers is computed using the basic rule f = - 1 and the rules ofalgebra: (a+ ib) ? (c + id) = ac + ibc + iad + i2bd = (ac - bd) + i(bc + ad).
EXAMPLE 1 Compute the product of 3 + i6 and 7 - i. (3 + i6). (7 - i) =(3 ? 7 - 6. ( -1)) + i(6. 7 + 3 ? ( -1)) = 27 + i39.
The complex conjugate z of z is formed by changing the sign of theimaginary part of z:
a+ ib =a- ib.
The product of a complex……（省略）
