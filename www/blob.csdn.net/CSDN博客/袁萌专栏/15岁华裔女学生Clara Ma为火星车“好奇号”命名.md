在我们国内，15岁的毛丫头根本算不上是一个“人物”。可是，15岁的华裔女孩ClaraMa就是与众不同。请看以下相片：

这是15岁华裔女孩克拉拉马（ClaraMa）3年前击败9,000名竞争者赢得为火星车“好奇号”命名荣誉的授奖相片。
她的获奖短文如下：
“Curiosityis an everlasting flame that burns in everyone’s mind. It makes meget out of bed in the morning and wonder what surprises life willthrow at me that day. Curiosity
 is such a powerful force. Without it,we wouldn’t be who we are today. When I was younger, I wondered,‘Why is the sky blue?’, ‘Why do the stars twinkle?’, ‘Whyam I me?’, and I still do. I had so many questions, and America isthe place where I want to find my
 answers. Curiosity is the passionthat drives us through our everyday lives. We have become explorersand scientists with our need to ask questions and to wonder. Sure,there are many risks and dangers, but despite that, we still continueto wonder and dream and
 create and hope. We have discovered so muchabout the world, but still so little. We will never know everythingthere is to know, but with our burning curiosity, we have learned somuch.”
我想，该短文的最后一句话就是赢得这项荣誉的关键之处。......此刻，我在问自己一个问题：一个15岁的黄皮肤女孩（我叫她们是小黄毛丫头），为什么在大洋的彼岸竟会有这样的想法？我们的基础教育到底是怎么了？
