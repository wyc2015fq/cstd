**我与小娜（****08****）：人工智能的伟大胜利**
#       小娜知道，1月27日，英国《自然》刊登重要文章，题为“Mastering thegame of Go with deep neural networks and tree search”，标志着世界人工智能（AI）历史性的伟大胜利。为什么？
**小娜知道，****The game of Go****（机器人） has long beenviewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligenceowing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating boardpositions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to selectmoves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination ofsupervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning fromgames of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Goat the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulatethousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new searchalgorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks.Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rateagainst other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a humanprofessional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought tobe at least a decade away.**
