**3.4 CONTINUITY**
    Intuitively,a curve
*y= f(x)* is continuous if it forms an unbroken line,that is, whenever *x*1 is close to *x*2, *f(x*1*) *is close to *f(x*2*)*. To make this intuitive idea into a mathematical definition, we substitute “ infinitely close “ for “close”.
**DEFINITION**
*f is said to be continuous at a point c if:*
(i) *f is defined at c;*
(ii) *whenever x is infinitely close to c, f(x) is infinitely close to f(c).*
If* f*is not continuous at *c *it is said to be *discontinuous* at *c.*
When* f* is continuous at
*c*, the entire part of the curve where *x *≈ c will be visible in an infinitesimal microscope aimed at the point (*c, f(c*)), as shown in Figure 3.4.1(a). But if
*f* is discontinuous at *c*, some values of *f(x)* where*x *≈ *c *will either be undefined or outside the range of vision of the microscope, as in Figure 3.4.1(b).
Continuity,like the derivative, can be expressed in terms of limits. Again theproof is immediate from the definitions.

**THEOREM1**
***fis continuous at c if and only if***
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0063.png)
Asan application, we have a set of rules for combining continuousfunctions. They can be proved either by the corresponding rules forlimits ( Table 3.3.1 in
 Section 3.3) or by computing standard parts.
**THEOREM 2**
*Supposef and g are continuous at c.*
(i)*For any constant k, the function k· f (x) is continuous at c .*
(ii)*f(x ) + g(x) is continuous at c.*
(iii)*f(x) ·g(x)  is continuous at c.*
(iv)*If g(c)*≠ *0, then f(x)/g(x) is continuous at c.*
(v)*If f(c) is positive and n is an integer, then**_______**is continuous at c.*
Byrepeated use of Theorem 2, we see that all of the following functionsare continuous at
*c*.
Everypolynomial function.
Everyrational function
*f(x)/ g(x)*, where *f(x)* and *g(x)*are polynomials and *g(c)* ≠ 0.
Thefunctions
*f(x) = x r* ,  *r* rational and *x*positive.
Sometimesa function
*f(x ) *will be undefined at a point *x= c*while the limit
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0064.png)
exists.When this happens, we can make the function continuous at
*c* bydefining *f(c)=L.*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0065.png)**EXAMPLE1   **Let    
At anypoint
*c* ≠ 1, *f* is continuous. But *f(1)* isundefined so *f* is discontinuous at 1. However,
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0066.png)
We canmake
*f* continuous at 1 by defining

(See Figure3.4.2)
Interms of a dependent variable
*y= f(x),* the definition ofcontinuity takes the following form, where Δ*y=f(c+*Δ*x) -f(c).*
*yis continuous at x=c if;*
(i)*y is defined at x=c.*
(ii)*whenever*Δ*x is infinitesimal, *Δ *y isinfinitesimal.*

Tosummarize, given a function
*y=f(x) *defined at *x=c*, allthe statements below are equivalent.
(1) *f is continuous at c.*
*(2) Whenever x*≈
*c, f(x) *≈ *f(c).*
(3) *Whenever st(x)= c, st(f(x))=f(c).*
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0070.png)(4) 
*(5)y is continuous at x=c.*
*(6)Whenever*Δ*x is infinitesimal, *Δ*y isinfinitesimal.*
Ournext theorem is that differentiability implies continuity. That is,the set of differentiable functions at
*c* is a subset of theset of continuous functions at *c*. (See Figure 3.4.3)
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0071.png)

**Figure3.4.3**
**THEOREM3**
If *f*is differentiable at
*c *then *f* is continuous at *c.*
***PROOF*** Let
*y=f(x),* and let Δ*x* be a nonzero infinitesimal.Then Δ*y*/Δ*x* is infinitely close to
*f *′*(c)*and is therefore finite. Thus Δ*y=*Δ*x(*Δ*y/*Δ*x)*is the product of an infinitesimal and a finite number, so Δ*y*isinfinitesimal.
Forexample, the transcendental functions sin
*x*, cos *x*, *ex*are continuous for all *x*, and 1n *x* is continuous for *x*> 0. Theorem 3 can be used to show that combinations of thesefunctions are continuous.
**EXAMPLE 2**Find as large a set as you can on which the function
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0072.png)
is continuous.
sin*x* is continuous for all
*x*. 1n (*x*+1) iscontinuous whenever *x*+1>0, that is, *x *> -1. Thenumerator sin *x* 1n(*x*+1) is thus continuous whenever
*x*> -1. The denominator *x*² -4 is continuous for all *x*but is zero when
*x*= + 2. Therefore *f(x)* iscontinuous whenever *x* > -1 and
*x*≠ 2.
Thenext two examples give functions which are continuous but notdifferentiable at a point
*c*.
**EXAMPLE3**
Thefunction
*y*= *x* 1/3 is continuous but not differentiableat *x*=0. (See Figure 3.4.4(a).)
Wehave seen before that it is not differentiable at
*x*=0. It iscontinuous because if Δ*x* is infinitesimal then so is
Δ*y*= (0+Δ*x*)1/3 - 0 1/3 = (Δ*x*) 1/3
**EXAMPLE 4**
Theabsolute value function
*y=|x|* is continuous but notdifferentiable at the point *x*= 0.
(SeeFigure 3.4.4(b).)
Wehave already shown that the derivative does not exist at
*x*=0.To see that the function is continuous, we note that for anyinfinitesimal
*x*,
Δ*y*=|0+Δ*x*| - |0 |= |Δ*x*|
and thus*y* is infinitesimal.

Thepath of a bouncing ball is a series of parabolas shown in Figure3.4.5. The curve is continuous everywhere. At the points
*a1, a2,a3,* …… Where the ball bounces, the curve is continuous butnot differentiable. At other points , the curve is both continuousand differentiable.
Inthe classical kinetic theory of gases, a gas molecule is assumed tobe moving at a constant velocity in a straight line except at theinstant of time when it
 collides with another molecule or the wall ofthe container. Its path is then a broken line in space, as in Figure3.4.6.

**Figure3.4.6**
Theposition in three dimensional space at time
*t* can berepresented by three functions
*x=f(t),  y=g(t),  z=h(t).*
Allthree functions,
*f, g*, and *h* are continuous for allvalues of *t*. At the time
*t* of a collision, at least oneand usually all three derivatives *dx/ dt, dy/dt, dx/dt*will beundefined because the speed or direction of the molecule changesabruptly. At any other time
*t*, when no collision is takingplace, all the three derivatives *dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt*willexist.
Thefunctions we shall ordinarily encounter in this book will be definedand have a derivative at all but perhaps a finite number of points ofan interval. The
 graph of such a function will be a smooth curvewhere the derivative exists. 
Atpoints where the curve has a sharp corner (like 0 in|
*x|* ) ora vertical tangent line (like 0 in *x*1/3), the function iscontinuous but not differentiable (see Figure 3.4.7). At points wherethe function is undefined or there is a jump, or the value approachesinfinity or oscillates wildly, the function
 is discontinuous (seeFigure 3.4.8).

**Figure3.4.8 **                 Points where *f* is discontinuous
Thenext theorem is similar to the Chain Rule for derivatives.
**THEOREM 4 **
*If fis continuous at c and G is continuous at f(c), then the function*
*g(x) =G(f(x))*
*is alsocontinuous at c. That is, a continuous function of a continuousfunction is continuous.*
**PROOF** Let
*x *be infinitely close to but not equal to *c*. Then
*st(g(x))= st(G(f(x))) = G(st(f(x))) = G(f(c)) = g(c).*
For example, the following functions are continuous;
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0079.png)
Hereare two examples illustrating two types of discontinuities.
**EXAMPLE5**  The function  
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0080.png)
iscontinuous at every real point except
*x*= 1 and *x*=2. 
Atthese two points
*g(x)* is undefined (Figure 3.4.9).
**EXAMPLE6**The *greatest integer function [x], *shown in Figure3.4.10, is defined by
[*x*]*=*the greatest integer *n *such that *n *≤ *x.*

Foreach integer
*n*, [*n*] is equal to *n*. The function[*x*] is continuous when
*x* is not an integer but isdiscontinuous when *x* is an integer *n.* At an integer *n,*both one- sided limits exist but are different,
![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0084.png)![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0085.png)
Thegraph of [*x*] looks like a staircase. It has a step, or jumpdiscontinuity, at each integer
*n*. The function [*x*] willbe useful in the last section of this chapter. Some hand calculatorshave a key for either the greatest integer function or for thesimilar function that gives [*x*] for positive
*x* and
[*x*]+ 1 for negative
*x*.      
Functionswhich are ‘ continuous on an interval’ will play an importantrole in this chapter. Intervals were discussed in section 1.1. Recallthat closed intervals
 have the form 
[ *a,b*],
Openintervals have one of the forms.
(*a,b*), (
*a,*∞ ), ( -∞ , b),   ( - ∞ , ∞ ),
andhalf-open intervals have one of the forms
(*a,b*), (
*a,b* ), ( a , ∞),   ( - ∞ , *b* ),
*Inthese intervals, a is called the lower endpoint and b, the upperendpoint. The symbol -*∞
*indicates that there is no lowerendpoint, while *∞ *indicates that there is no upper endpoint.*
**DEFINITION**
*Wesay that f is continuous on an open interval I if f is continuous atevery point c in I. If in addition f has a derivative at every pointof I, we say that f is differentiable on I.*
Todefine what is meant by a function continuous on a closed interval,we introduce the notions of continuous from the right and continuousfrom the left, using
 one-sided limits.

*x*= -1, let Δ*x* be positive ![](http://netdisk0.mail.sina.com.cn/object/32/23321735e98005c3700439709523e872.files/file0093.png)infinitesimal.Then

Thenumber inside the radical is positive infinitesimal, so Δ*y*isinfinitesimal. This shows that the function is continuous from theright at
*x*= -1. Similar reasoning shows it is continuous fromthe left at *x*= 1.
