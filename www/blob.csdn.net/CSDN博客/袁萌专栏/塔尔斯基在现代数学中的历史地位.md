                        众所周知，鲁宾逊在模型论的基础上创立了非标准分析，恢复了无穷小的名誉，而模型论的“老爷子”是塔尔斯基！
        站在无穷小微积分背后的是塔尔斯基学派。这句话是有分量的。
        本文附上模型论的发展历史，实事求是，评价历史人物。

附：模型论的诞生：
        Model theory as a subject has existed since approximately the middleof the 20th century. However some earlier research, especially in mathematicallogic, is often regarded as being of a model-theoretical nature in retrospect.The first significant result in what is now model theory was a special case of thedownward L?wenheim–Skolem theorem, published by Leopold L?wenheim in 1915. Thecompactness theorem was implicit in work by Thoralf Skolem,[3] but it was firstpublished in 1930, as a lemma in Kurt G?del's proof of his completenesstheorem. The L?wenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem receivedtheir respective general forms in 1936 and 1941 from Anatoly Maltsev.
模型论的壮年时期：
        The development of model theory can be traced to Alfred Tarski, amember of the Lwów–Warsaw school during the interbellum. Tarski's work includedlogical consequence, deductive systems, the algebra of logic, the theory ofdefinability, and the semantic definition of truth, among other topics. Hissemantic methods culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeleystudents developed in the 1950s and 60s. These modern concepts of model theoryinfluenced（影响了） Hilbert's program（希尔伯特计划） and modern mathematics（现代数学）.
        这就是结论。
