        在西方学术界，直到1983年才对马克思数学手稿（英文版）有所了解。
        外国学者对马克思数学手稿的乐学评价是完全肯定的，同时也注意到中国非标准分析学者的工作。请见附件。

        Mathematicalmanuscripts of Karl Marx 
        The Mathematicalmanuscripts of Karl Marx consist mostly of Karl Marx's attempts to understandthe foundations of infinitesimal calculus, from around 1873–1883. A Russianedition edited by Sofya Yanovskaya was eventually published in 1968, and anEnglish translation was published in 1983 (Marx 1983).
     According toHubert C. Kennedy, Marx "[...] seems to have been unaware of the advancesbeing made by continental mathematicians in the foundations of differentialcalculus, including the work of Cauchy." In the same text, Kennedy says"While Marx's analysis of the derivative and differential had no immediateeffect on the historical development of mathematics, Engels（恩格斯断言）' claim that Marxmade "independent discoveries" is certainly justified（合理的）. It isinteresting to note that Marx's operational definition of the differentialanticipated（预示着） 20th century developmentsin mathematics, and there is another aspect of the differential, that seems tohave been seen by Marx, that has become a standard part of modern textbooks—theconcept of the differential as the principal part of an increment.",implying that Marx's apprehension and interpretation of calculus was far from short-sighted（目光短浅的）.   
        This may havecontributed to an interest in nonstandard analysis among Chinese mathematicians(Dauben 1998).
