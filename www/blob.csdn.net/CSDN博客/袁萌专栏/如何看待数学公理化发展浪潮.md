1902年出本发行的希尔伯特《几何学基础》引发了二十世纪数学公理化发展的浪潮，公理化解析几何、微积分相继建立。
坦率地说，我们向全国高校批量投放的连环画微积分节课书中的每张示意图片都是该书作者基于希尔伯特《几何学基础》提出的20条几何公理精心绘制出来的（属于原始创作）。
我们应该如何看待数学公理化发展浪潮？顺其自然，不要反其道而行之。

INTRODUCTION.
Geometry, like arithmetic, requires for its logical development only a small number of simple, fundamental principles. These fundamental principles are called the axioms of geometry. The choice of the axioms and the investigation of their relations to one another is a problem which, since the time of Euclid, has been discussed in numerous excellent memoirs to be found in the mathematical literature.1 This problem is tantamount to the logical analysis of our intuition of space. The following investigation is a new attempt to choose for geometry a simple and complete set of independent axioms and to deduce from these the most important geometrical theorems in such a manner as to bring out as clearly as possible the signi cance of the different groups of axioms and the scope of the conclusions to be derived from the individual axioms.
