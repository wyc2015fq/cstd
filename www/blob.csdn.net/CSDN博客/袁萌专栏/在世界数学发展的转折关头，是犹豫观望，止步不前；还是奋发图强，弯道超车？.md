        根据美国数学史专家Tropp的最新研究表明，当今，世界数学发展正处在一个转折关口。我们该怎么办？是犹豫观望，止步不前；还是奋发图强，弯道超车？         
        反观我们国内，本文所提问题完全具有针对性。大家心知肚明。
        坦率地说，“无穷小微积分”网站所做的事情，也是“事出有因”。

第一章第1.1节的内容
**Inﬁnitesimals: History & Application**
1.1. Overview（概观）
Inﬁnitesimals have enjoyed an extensive and scandalous history. Almost as soon as the Pythagoreans suggested the concept 2500 years ago, Zeno proceeded to drown it in paradox. Nevertheless, many mathematicians continued to use inﬁnitesimals until the end of the 19th century because of their intuitive appeal in understanding continuity. When the foundations of calculus were formalized by Weierstrass, et al. around 1872, they were banished from mathematics. As the 20th century began, the mathematical community oﬃcially regarded inﬁnitesimals as numerical chimeras, but engineers and physicists continued to use them as heuristic aids in their calculations. In 1960, the logician Abraham Robinson discovered a way to develop a rigorous theory of inﬁnitesimals. His techniques are now referred to as Nonstandard Analysis, which is a small but growing ﬁeld in mathematics. Practioners have found many intuitive, direct proofs of classical results. They have also extended mathematics in new directions, which may eventually result in fruitful discoveries.
