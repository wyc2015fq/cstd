可能错误不是我说的所在，但我这样把错误解决了，这里就仅仅做个记录，防止自己忘记
我的解决方法
　　　１．整个工程名＋路径名太长了，把这些名称尽量减短就好了．

大家仔细看英文.
One thing I’ve neglected to tell in my original post: I’m building my 
platform from the command prompt, using the environment generated by platform 
builder. The main point here is that the release directory is not located 
under \Wince500, it's located under a deep stack of 12 folders. The total 
path length including the release directory itself is 124 characters. 
Changing my release directory to a shorter path solved my problem. My guess 
is that makeimg has internal buffers that are limited to a certain size and 
that were the source of the "Out of buffer space" error.
What is really suspicious is that the same configuration was working fine 
before I started installing the QFEs. Maybe Microsoft has fixed a bug in 
makeimg and I was just lucky to get my platform to compile... who knows
如果英文看不懂..
其实: 
说白了就是我的release目录路径太长了。。。
