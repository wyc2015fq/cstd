|0down vote|Here is what I do with USB serial devices:- ```cd /dev/serial/by-id```- ```ls -l```For example:```root@toaster:/dev/serial/by-id# ls -l``````total 0``````lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Jan 1 1970 usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_A7035K2R-if00-port0 -> ../../ttyUSB0```- Make a symlink from this L-O-N-G name to a name of your choosing in a directory of your choosing. In my case, it is a system device and only root controls it so I make a link in `/root`, like:```ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_A7035K2R-if00-port0 /root/easydigi```- In your programs or whatever needs the device name of the serial device, you just use your link, in my case above "/root/easydigi", as the replacement for the "/dev/ttyUSB0".|
