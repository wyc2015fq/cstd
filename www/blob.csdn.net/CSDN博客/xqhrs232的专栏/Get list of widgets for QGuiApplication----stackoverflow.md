The problem is that there is no `topLevelWidgets()` function in `QGuiApplication`, it is in `QApplication`. Of course I could use `QApplication` instead of `QGuiApplication`, but the application already exists and I can't change source codes. I'm writing plugin.I think if `Qt` allows you to write place UI elements for application using `QGuiApplication` class, it should give some way to get those elements, but maybe I'm wrong.Any ideas?|
