Reviewer Comments for USAM 2005.6

Title of Paper: ***

Authors: ***

Ref. No. USAM2005.6

RECOMMENDATION: PUBLISH WITH REVISION

I appreciate the progress and effort that the authors have made. I note some significant progress in

this revised article. By replacing "new" with the word of "simple", I take back my argument about

the novelty of the method in making soft metal nanoparticles, because it is the first article that

report to pulverizing Sn metal into the size as small as 50 nm. Maybe the word "facile" is more

appropriate.

I am still having trouble understanding the mechanism of the formation of Sn nanoparticle

proposed by the author. Because the hardness of Sn is 1.5 in mineralogical scale, where Mg and

Zn have 2.5 (Samsonov, G.V. "Handbook of the Physicochemical Properties of the Elements"

IFI/Plenum, 1968, pp. 432), it is not surprising that Sn can be pulverizing into small particles

under high-intensity of ultrasound. What I have trouble with is that the surface area should not be

large enough to have the authors worried about in reducing the surface energy of particles with

aggregation (I calculated the surface area of Sn particles at 50 nm is c.a. 12 m2/g). I really don't

think the oxide coating and solvent molecules would depress the aggregation because I don't think

there would be aggregation occurring.

Overall, it is my opinion that the article should be published if the authors can clarify the question

about the mechanism of aggregation.

Please note that the references are not uniform in format from No 15 down.

Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer #1: Major Revision

This paper reports on the development of a stripping voltammetry procedure for the determination

of thallium and cadmium in water using a modified glassy carbon electrode with a

Langmuir-Blodgett film of p-allylcalix[4]arene coating.

The study is well planned and performed. Additionally, the topic that it covers is interesting;

consequently, I feel that the paper merits publication in ACA, but with some revision. Following

are some aspects for the authors to consider:

1 The characterization of Langmuir monolayers is made as usual through the measurement of the

surface pressure versus area isotherms. Some characteristics of isotherms should be offered, i.e.,

the limiting area per molecule (it seems to be around 0.8 nm2/molecule from Figure 2) and the

collapse pressure. Additionally, more information on LB film preparation should be included in

2.3 section (p. 5) related to the solutions used and their concentrations.

2 All reagents used for experimental work and the suppliers should be indicated in Section 2.2

(p.2), not only for the Tl2SO4 reagent.

3 The lifetime of the proposed electrode must be discussed with experimental data.

4 The central idea of this study is the development of a new non-mercury electrode for the

stripping analysis of metals. This means, additionally, the correct study of potential interferent

species to compare with conventional electrodes. The study of interferents must be improved by

including more ions such as Pb(II), Bi(III), Ni(II) or Cu(II) and giving results in a new table.

5 The precision of the proposed procedure must be studied.

6 The applicability of procedure to drinking water is doubtful taking into account the detection

limit found (>1 mg.L-1) and the natural level of analytes in waters. In fact, the application that the

authors offer is to spiked clean water (lake water and tap water). Did the authors consider

potential application to polluted water?

7 As the authors propose the simultaneous determination of Tl and Cd and since Figure 4

suggests some overlapping of stripping g*L-1 level, it seems necessary ?voltamograms for both

metals at a 150 to study the resolution of both signals in the lab, indicating the concentration

range for both metals in which resolution is possible.

8 The heading of Table 1 indicates recovery and precision for the tap and lake water analyzed,

but the table does not include data for precision.

9 The whole manuscript should be revised for some typewriting errors and the English should be

improved.

10 In brief, I think that the idea is interesting but the authors need to improve some aspects of

their work as indicated above n order to demonstrate its real feasibility.

Reviewer #2: Minor Revision

This is an interesting paper focusing on the use of LB films of calix[4]arenes for the determination

of thallium and cadmium.

Its publication can be recommended, after considering the following points:

1) Why are they assuming that the calix[4]arenes are interacting with the glassy carbon electrode

through the phenolic groups, rather than through the hydrophobic aromatic allyl groups? This

possibility would not be preferred using the LB technique?

2) The binding of the metal ions would not be more favorable at the lower rim OH groups?

3) Spectroscopic, and microscopy (SPM, TEM) investigation of the LB-Tl, Cd surfaces would be

very informative in this case.

4) Considering that only one layer has been deposited, and the evidence provided by the authors

that it remains permeable to large ions, such as ferrocyanide, how one can be sure that the metal

deposition is not occurring at the surface holes? Otherwise, how a non conducting layer would

mediate electron transfer in the reduction/stripping process?

5) A very interesting result would be the comparison between the behavior of the LB films of the

t-butyl and allyl calix[4]arenes.

Language revision will be necessary.

我的回复：

Following are our response about reviewers’ comment to our manuscript No ***-***-00**0:

1 The following sentence was additional among the text in order to contribute more information of

LB film.

‘The limiting area and collapsing pressure of p-allylcalix[4]arene is 0.75 nm2 per molecule and

34mNm respectively on pure water ‘ was provided in section 3.1.

‘Measurement of π-A isotherms and preparation of LB monolayer were performed with JML-04

LB trough (Shanghai Zhongchen Company, P R China). The spreading solutions were prepared by

dissolving about 1-2 mg of the compound in 10 ml of dichloromethane. All spreading solutions

were kept at 5 °C and renewed every 2 weeks.’ was provided in section 2.3.

2 CdCl2 and other chemicals were purchased from local company as analytical reagents and used

without further purification. Therefore, this sentence will be appeared in the text.

3 The response of AllylCA-GCE did not change remarkably after two months. The lifetime of

proposed electrode should be longer. We add the first sentence in our revision.

4 In order to make clear, one table about interferences will be appeared in our revision.

5 The precision of proposed procedure were given in the table 2.

6 We consider that this electrode can detect metal ion of polluted water. Unfortunately，suitable

sullage sample was not found in our area.

7 We want to ensure they won’t interfere with each other. It seems to the peak of thallium and

cadmium could not be separated entirely for partly overlapping in Fig 4 A.

8 We calculate relative standard deviation of method and provided it in table 2.

9 we correct some typewriting errors which were appeared in our manuscript.

10 The molecular orientation can be controlled easily using LB technique. The type Z LB film

means hydrophilic group interact with glassy carbon electrode.

11 We have done experiment on electrode modified with calixarene(pasted on the surface of GC

electrode), that is, molecular orientation was arranged freely. The response decrease sharply. We

suppose it can due to decreasing of amount of allyl group on the same area. Therefore, we

supposed that would not happened

12 The spectroscopic or microscopy investigation is unnecessary base on the above reason.

13 Metal can be deposited on the surface hole. However, the response of bare electrode is much

less than that of AllylCA-GCE. We suppose this can be neglected.

14 The ferrocyanide is the larger ion, and it can not permeate the calixarene cavity and exchange

electron with electrode. However, the supporting electrolyte can permeate the cavity freely.

15 The electrode modified with LB film of p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene cannot recognize thallium and

cadmium at all.

16 We apologized for our poor English. We will try to improve it in revision.

17 In order to highlight the change what we have done, the color of text changed will become red.

Dear Editor：

This was my article for your magazine“Preparation and Structure Characterization of Long Single

Crystalline CuO Nanoribbons” In this communication, we have developed a novel simple and

convenient route to the abundant synthesis of long CuO nanoribbons on conducting Aluminium

substrate. TEM and XRD studies indicated that these CuO nanoribbons were single crystal with

single crystalline plane of monoclinic {111}. The nanoribbons obtained are about several hundreds

nanometers in width, from tens to one hundred nanometers in thickness and their length can be up

to one hundred microns. Because these CuO nanoribbons not only are perfect single crystalline

but also are single crystalline plane, they can be expected to have special properties and purpose,

such as nanoelectronic device and heterogeneous catalyst etc. In addition, the novel method seems

can also be used to prepare 1D nanostructures of other metallic oxides.

Subject: Message for ****l

A little earlier, I received an email message from your office rejecting the manuscript I submitted

as SUSC_edwardsacher_20020322/1, editorial reference number SS 02192. Needless to say, I was

surprised at not being given the opportunity to rebut. Now that I have read the referees' comments,

I am doubly surprised.

Consider Referee A. His sole disagreement, without offering reasons to the contrary, is that the

phenomena we find are attributed to several different free radicals formed on bond breaking. He

argues that stable free radicals in graphite exist only in vacancies and at surfaces. We agree. Where

we appear to disagree is whether or not the breaking of a C-C bond creates a vacancy: his point of

view, as stated in his comment, is that such free radicals rejoin to reform bonds. Unfortunately,

literature data going back many decades prove him wrong.

I presume that Referee A is from the group that wrote reference 21 in the manuscript since they

note that one of their four attributions is given incorrectly in the manuscript. I thank him for

catching it; it will be corrected in the next version.

Now, consider Referee B. Of his list of major points, the first asks for clearer referencing, the next

four ask that residuals and error bars be included in several plots, the sixth (erroneously numbered

5) asks for a clarification in a figure and the last questions the applicability of a reference.

While Referee A may not like our free radical formation mechanism, neither he nor Referee B

(who doesn't mention it at all) has refuted it or offered evidence as to why it may not be so. It is

interesting to note that we, the authors, have, in fact done so in the middle of p. 12 of our

manuscript, where we offer several interesting opposing views.

Furthermore, our evidence for the presence of free radicals is not questioned, nor is our N

hybridization scheme ( which has never appeared in previous papers on the subject). Also not

discussed are the supporting results of the Raman and TOF-SIMS studies. Based on all this, and

more I will not spend time discussing, we find it difficult to understand how you could possibly

reject the manuscript without the opportunity to revise it.

Could you explain your decision? I look forward to hearing from you.

编辑的回复：

Dear Dr. ***,

Thank you for your message below. I understand your concern.

I was most troubled by the incorrect listings in Table I of all four components from Reference

21. Your letter says that the error was only in one of the four, but they all look different to me and

apparently to the referee. There were also a number of other features which seemed to be easily

found errors that gave me great concern not by the importance of any single error but rather by

their frequency and the fact that they should really have been caught by the authors before

submission.

Sincerely,

********

我的再去信：

Thank you for responding so quickly. I have read your comment and compared it with the

comments of the referees. I must disagree with your contention that all four of the attributions

taken from reference 21 are in error. In fact, if you glance at reference 21, pages 325-327, you will

find their discussion of the attributions of others to the N1s peaks, and their assessments of those

attributions. They are unclear as to their own view and never state it clearly; we tried to give what

we thought it was, which is probably why Referee A made his comment. However, we call your

attention to the first sentence of the last paragraph of the discussion, which begins with the words,

"While we cannot definitely assign the N1s peaks .....". If, indeed, Referee A is a member of the

team that wrote reference 21, the ideas expressed in his comment must have originated later. I

submit that this is not a cause for rejection of the manuscript.

Further, the comments of Referee B do not concern easily found errors; rather, they concern the

addition of residuals and error bars, whose purpose is to enhance and clarify our manuscript.

Certainly, this is typical of requests made for revision.

As I noted in yesterday's letter, none of this warrants rejection. Indeed, neither of the referees

mentioned it. Therefore, I request your permission to submit a revised manuscript. Could you tell

me how to do this?

Many thanks.

A-2 REVIEW

Suggestions and comments:

Paper gives a new assignment for the C1s and N1s XPS components of the CNx thin layer. The

authors discuss it from a view point of sp and sp2 hybridization in the compound. Although I

cannot believe their conclusion for the solid, reader will judge whether it is reasonable or not.

Thus the paper should be published in order to open the discussion. I feel, however, there are too

many figures in the paper. The Residual plots in Fig. 2a and 2b are unnecessary at least. In the

manuscript obtained by down loading the PDF file, there are many mistypes, probably occurred in

the transfer process.

In the manuscript, 1. many hyphens or minus signals, and power components are dropped from the

manuscript. 2. ri ented ? oriented ( in Abstract, page 1) 3. id ? did (page 2, line 18) 4. neighbor s ?

B-2 REVIEW:

Surface Science paper by: D.-Q. Yang, E. Sacher, ‘A spectroscopic study of CNx formation by the

keVN2+…. (SS02192)

Authors have plot residuals in Figure 2a, as it has been asked. However the residuals clearly show

peaks instead of being straight line (the line of residual has wiggles – see top of Fig. 2a).

This indicates that the peak fitting was not done correctly. To get the straight line the number of

peaks or/and their positions and widths need to be determined correctly. Introduction of a new

peak means that a new chemical component is present and when a new position of the peak is

introduced it means that a different chemical component is present (this mean that a different

interpretation of data have to be done to current one in the paper). Therefore, since all analysis and

interpretation of the data in this paper relay on this fitting procedure - I do not believe to current

interpretation of the data given in this paper.

In my opinion much better analysis of data is needed and/or the data needs to be taken with a

better resolution so that peaks in C1s core level are resolved before it is worth publishing in Surf.

Sci.

修改说明：

Dear Professor Campbell:

I submit the revised manuscript, “A spectroscopic study of CNx formation by the keV N2+

irradiation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surfaces”, as well as nine revised figures. The

revision was carried out as a result of the comments of the two reviewers. Detailed comments

follow.

Referee A

As the reviewer notes, we do, indeed, attribute all the implanted N components to free radicals. As

we noted, the free radicals are initially produced on bond cleavage by the irradiating beam., as we

have previously shown. The N can only react with these chain end fragments, retaining, at least to

some extent, the free radical character of the original fragments. Since the production of free

radicals by hemolytic scission has been known for many decades, we see no reason to defend this

point.

The reviewer’s next point has to do with the N1s XPS attributions used in the paper by Kusunoki

et al. When one reads reference 21, pages 325-327, one finds their discussion of the attributions of

others to the N1s peaks, and their assessments of those attributions. They are unclear as to their

own view and never state it clearly; we tried to give what we thought it was, which is probably

why Referee A made his comment. However, we call your attention to the first sentence of the last

paragraph of the Discussion, which begins with the words, "While we cannot definitely assign the

N1s peaks .....". If, indeed, Referee A is a member of the team that wrote reference 21, the ideas

expressed in his comment must have originated later. For this reason, we have changed our

attributions in the text, as well as in Table I, to agree with those of the reviewer, and note its

subsequent communication.

Referee B

Major point 1: The difficulty here appears to be with the phraseology. What we meant was that the

attributions from many sources contradict each other; since they cannot all be correct, many of the

attributions are obviously in error. We have reworded this to make it clearer.

Major point 2: The reviewer asks to see residuals. This is easy to do, since we always use residuals

in our peak fitting. Thus, we have replaced the figures with those showing residuals. Further, we

have added a paragraph to the Experimental section, to indicate the philosophy used in employing

the residuals. This was done to avoid any confusion with the criteria employed.

Major point 3: The reviewer is concerned with the use of a straight line to represent the data in Fig

5a, and wishes to see error bars. So as not to confuse the data, we show error bars for the first

points of each plot in the figure. Further, we point out the well-known problem encountered on

angle resolution: the circle being detected at a perpendicular take-off angle becomes an ellipse as

the angle approaches grazing incidence, causing intensity errors. We note that, until an angle of

60° degrees from the perpendicular, the data are well represented by a straight, horizontal line, and

we illustrate this for the uppermost of the plots.

Major point 4: We do not exactly understand the overall thrust of this point, since several different

ones are being made concerning Fig. 4a. We have added error bars to the first points, so as not to

confuse and overlap the data. In addition, the reviewer asks for rescaling, to more clearly see C3

and C4. While we believe that such rescaling is unnecessary, and C3 and C4 are already clearly

seen, we actually tried to do this. We tried, and decided against, logarithmic rescaling of the

ordinate because the plots were distorted and the upper plots were compressed. We tried, and

decided against, another figure for the lower plots because we already have fifteen figures.

Major point 5 (called point 4 by the reviewer): The reviewer asks for error bars. They have been

added to the first points of Figs. 4b and 6. We have added them to all the points of Fig. 4c because

of the uncertainty in establishing the precision of the abscissa.

Major point 6 (called point 5 by the reviewer): The reviewer does not see any evidence for the

shift of the highest peak intensity of the N1s spectrum in Fig. 1b. We cannot understand this

request. Fig. 1b clearly shows that, on irradiation, the highest peak shifts from the one near 400.5

eV to the one near 399 eV. This is reworded to make it clearer.

Major point 7 (called point 6): The reviewer notes that the original reference [24] concerns the

Au-N bond and not the C-N bond. He is absolutely correct. We intentionally used this reference

since it deals with the type of analysis we were doing on nitride formation, and we thought the

reader would find it helpful to be aware of this. However, we understand the reviewer’s point: it

has been replaced with another reference, on the C-N bond.

All the minor points, some caused by problems with Word, as we notified you a few days after our

initial submission, have been corrected. We thank the reviewer for noting them.

We hope that the revision is acceptable.

P.O. Box 1234

**********

U.S.A.

Dear Dr. ******** :

You recently returned a review of our manuscript, JR88-2008. After having read it, my coauthors

and I are of the opinion that it does not remotely reach the standards we have come to expect from

JAP. We believe that this is due to the fact that the reviewer was poorly chosen, and has a

difficulty understanding the thrust of the manuscript. We offer the following rebuttal of his review.

In his first point, the reviewer offers his personal opinion that the penetration of oxygen into the

porous silicon determines the oxidation kinetics. He appears to assume that we are proposing this;

we are not, as the references clearly show. This was proposed, and accepted, long before. We

simply confirm it with correlations, and use them to make predictions.

In his second point, the reviewer says that we cannot do what we have, in fact, done: use XPS to

quantify the oxidation. Instead, he suggests that we use HF etching of the surface. However,

besides the fact that etching is inherently less accurate than XPS, the etching of porous material is

fraught with problems: in particular, the fact that water does not wet the silicon means that air in

the pores will prevent the water from entering, thus giving incorrect results.

In his third point, the reviewer suggests that we leave out all reference to photoluminescence. With

this request, he indicates that he has not understood the thrust of the paper: it is part of a series, as

indicated in the Introduction, on the source of the photoluminescence in oxidizing porous silicon.

Why should we want to remove any reference as to why we did the experiment?

In his fourth point, the reviewer asks whether silicon oxidation is good or bad. How does one

answer that? We are studying silicon oxidation, not because it is good or bad, but because we wish

to understand the phenomenon and its bearing on photoluminescence.

In his fifth point, the reviewer indicates that atmospheric oxidation depends on the atmospheric

conditions and is, therefore, not necessarily reproducible. This is true enough, and has been

understood for many years. That is why the accepted procedure is to quote the atmospheric

conditions during the experiment in the Experimental Section, as we have done.

In summary, the review of our manuscript is below the level of JAP, and we hope that you will be

able to either accept our rebuttal as is, or obtain another review. The final manuscript we will send

will also contain the corrections of the mechanical deficiencies noted.

Please accept my best wishes.

Sincerely yours,

****

B. 主编觉得反驳意见合适,同意找另一组评委. 下面新评委们的部分

结论

I have been asked to perform a two-fold task: to see whether the first reviewer's comments are

appropriate and, if not then, to offer my opinion of this research.

The previous Reviewer: It is unfortunately terribly evident that the previous reviewer has not the

slightest idea what the research performed here aims to accomplish. This is most clearly seen in

his 4th comment: "The reader do not understand: is it bad or good that Si is oxidized?" This

sentence shows two things. The first is, as claimed by me, is that the authors write in their

abstract:" A model has been developed to describe the room air oxidation process..." A model is

not a judgment of good and evil, nor should it be. The second item is that the first reviewer neither

knows how to read or to write American English. The first reviewer, however eminent he/she may

otherwise be, is linguistically disqualified for adequate review. I must this review this MS. de

novo.

The article: The authors write (page 3): “ It is our purpose to understand how porosity affects the

air oxidation of nanoporous Si…”. This seems to me to be an entirely worthwhile goal; the

problem for me is whether this project has been adequately performed and reported. As things

stand at the moment, it appears to me that answer is NO, although this might be remedied.

........

C. 我们根据他的意见进行了必要的修改,并解释了他的一些疑问,下面是修改后的Letter.

Dear Dr. ****:

I submit a revised version of Ms. #JR88-2008. The revisions were carried out according to the

suggestions of the last reviewer.

We feel it necessary to thank this reviewer for his most perceptive review. His comments clearly

bore on the subject of the manuscript, as opposed to those of the previous reviewer; we also thank

you for your willingness to send the manuscript to this second reviewer.

In reading the reviewer’s comments, several things became quite obvious. We had not made it

clear that the manuscript was one of a series on the investigation of the cause of

photoluminescence in nanoporous silicon, and we had not given enough information on our

previous results.

With the recent publication of our IR work in the Journal of Applied Physics, we were now in a

position to reference these results. It is now clear that both oxygen and water vapor oxidize the

porous silicon, with similar rates due to their reaction with silicon free radicals. Reference can

thus be made to the oxidation mechanism, as well as to our previous work justifying the use of the

Deal-Grove mechanism.

Without considering the reviewer’s points individually, we believe that we have responded to each

one. We have, for example, included an SEM photomicrograph of a porous sample, although this

was difficult due to the fact that these insulators charge. AFM photomicrographs were impossible

to obtain due to the high surface roughness of our samples.

We have made the mechanical corrections to the figures, as requested. Concerning the previous

Figure 2b, we have removed the text concerning oxidation time prediction, and have clarified our

need for the figure.

We hope that these changes lead to the acceptance of the manuscript, and look forward to hearing

from you.

Please accept my best wishes for the new year.

Sincerely yours,

****

最后主编接受修改意见，将文章发表。所以与评委和主编的沟通很重要。

有时候，评委的意见非常好，可以提高你文章的水平。

我的评审：

Comment to Author:

Comments：

1. The introduction (part 1) explains quite well why the researchers are interesting to alkene

isomerization which is very important to industry and organic synthesis.

2. In the second part (Results and discussion) author picked out the most effective catalyst

RuHCl(PPh3)3 which was synthesized in different method ,and a detailed description is given for

the catalytic results of different condition .It is attractive that the performance on 1-octadecene

isomerization by RuHCl(PPh3)3(s) presented high activity, thermal stability and the solvent-free

system . In the third part (Conclusion) a lengthy discussion follows to explain.

3. The work is of interest, but I feel that the paper could be better revised as follows:

(a)Describe the Mechanism of RuHCl (PPh3)3(s) catalyzed olefin isomerization in full detail

(section 2.5).in Figure 3, the mechanism should be expressed what it meant correctly.

(b) Figures 1 and 2 are necessary to be displayed clearly, and page number should be needed.

(c)Section 2.3 starts off well. This entire section seems very important. This section should form

the bulk of the discussion I would appreciate further studies have been carried out with

1-octadecene isomerization catalyzed by the complex RuHCl(PPh3)3(s) without solvent and

completed.

Final comment: This paper would be much better in quality when the mechanism of the

isomerization and 1-octadecene isomerization in the above work are detailed in this publication.

There are some errors in the CIF

i) In the preparation, only potassium salts were used as input, but a sodium salt was obtained?!

Please correct!

ii) There are no H atoms in the CIF, but it is written incorrectly:

"all the hydrogen atoms of the ligands were placed in geometrically calculated positions, and

included in the final refinement in the riding model approximation" Please, add a correct statement

about the H atom treatment to Experimental details!

iii) The number of water molecules per unit cell should be larger. If you have determined the water

contents by chemical or DTA/DTG measurement, add the corresponding results to the Exp. details!

If not, please note: The displacement parameters of some O atoms are too small for water

molecules which are only hydrogen bonded to water molecules and additionally disordered. O

atoms which have an occupancy factor of 0.5 and a complete

tetrahedral environment with O...O distances of about 3 Angstrom should have sof = 1. Disordered

O atoms can have sofs. smaller than 1, 0.5 for

an atom with one neighbored O atoms plus d(O...O) < 2.5 and 0.25 for an atom with 3 other

neighbored O atoms and d(O...O) < 2.5. Please check!

几天后老外再次回复：

Dear *****,

Thank you for your email!

Please, would you check following statements: The chemical compound, you have studied, is the

same as investigated by *****! The lattice parameters are nearly the same. *****made a

chemical analysis! And you? **** have found ** sodium cations from which only three have

appropriate Uani values. You have found exactly these three Na ions. You have assigned the

remaining charges to hydrogenium ions, because you could not find the other cations. But can the

latter Na ions not be disordered? Yes, they can do that! One example is your O21/O24. These two

positions seem

to represent one disordered Na ion. Why? They have, under considering of suitable Ueq values,

too short distance to each other, and then, too much electrons for one O atom. Additinally, they

have distances of 2.1... 2.5 ?to next O atoms, which is typical for Na-O bond lengths and not

typical for O...O distances of hydrogen bonds.

Since your measurement seems to be more accurate than that of *****, a publication of you data

as refinement of the Na~6~-compound is probably sensefull. Please, check it!

If you need any help to find the other Na atoms, you can send us the hkl file!

编辑的回信：

Dear ×××：

Just to answer your concerns:

1) Firstly, there is no problem waiting to send in your corrections until you and your partner have

both finished your revisions. You will probably receive reminder e-mails as these are automated

and I can't stop them, but just ignore these and send in the corrections when you have both

finished.

2) I will contact the editor to request the addition of an author, it should not be a problem.

3) Yes add the Founadtion name - include this with the corrections.

4) Biographies & photos are ideally required, but I would never force an author to include if they

would prefer not too. In terms of the photos if you would like to submit then the ideal way is a

jpeg or tif file if you have access to a digital camera, or even a phone camera. Or if you have

printed photos would you have access to a scanner? If it is difficult to get photos it is acceptable to

leave them out - perhaps just have a short biography for each author. Whatever you decide please

return the material with the corrections attached to the e-mail.

I hope this helps - don't hesitate to contact me if you have any other queries or concerns.

Dear Editor:

Thank you very much for your timely reply! I am sorry,I didn't give your completed information

about my paper.I have received the Reference for my article:×××for sure.I also have received the

mail from Mr××× with two attachments:TRANSFER OF COPYRIGHT FORM and OFFPRINTS

ORDER FORM.Thank you very much!

But I am not sure if the Editor-in-Chief of ×××asked me to revise the paper.On the one hand,An

E-mail from the Editor-in-Chief gave the Comments from the Editors and Reviewers in follows:

This is a very good paper, related work has to be better explained. Also need to discuss the

relationship to standards. For example, what are the standards currently existing and what

standards do we need., Also the authors could make the paper more concise. If these comments are

addressed then the paper can be published in the journal.

In my opinion,according to the Comments from the Editors and Reviewers,I should revise my

paper.On the other hand,in the on-line system,my paper is on "Submissions with a Decision",so I

can't submit my paper once again via the system .

So in my previous mail to you,I asked the second question.I want to know if I need to revise my

paper.If I needn't, what should I do to reply the Comments from the Editors and Reviewers?

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Have a nice weekend!!!

Sincerely Yours,

Mr. ×××
