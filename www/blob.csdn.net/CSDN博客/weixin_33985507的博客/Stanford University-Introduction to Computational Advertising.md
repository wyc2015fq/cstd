Course Information
 Overview 
 Computational advertising is an emerging new scientific sub-discipline, at the intersection of large scale search and text analysis, information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, classification, optimization, and microeconomics. The central problem of computational advertising is to find the "best match" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The context could be a user entering a query in a search engine ("sponsored search"), a user reading a web page ("content match" and "display ads"), a user watching a movie on a portable device, and so on. The information about the user can vary from scarily detailed to practically nil. The number of potential advertisements might be in the billions. Thus, depending on the definition of "best match" this problem leads to a variety of massive optimization and search problems, with complicated constraints, and challenging data representation and access problems.  The solution to these problems provides the scientific and technical foundations for the $20 billion online advertising industry.
 This course aims to provide  a good introduction to the main algorithmic  issues and solutions in computational advertising, as currently applied to building platforms for various online advertising formats.  At the same time we intend to briefly survey the economics and marketplace aspects of the industry, as well as some of the research frontiers.   The intended audience are students interested in the practical and theoretical aspects of web advertising.
 The tentative list of topics include:  The online advertising landscape; Marketplace and economics; Data representation and optimization challenges in online advertising;  The information retrieval approach to textual ads selection; Sponsored search; Context match; Display advertising; Behavioral targeting; Emerging formats and technologies: mobile, aps, games, etc.
 There are no formal prerequisites but some familiarity with the basic concepts of probability, economics, machine learning, and optimization is expected and good web skills are required.   The course will likely include a "real life" project where students will have a budget to advertise for a certain business and will be required to analyze and justify their choices.
