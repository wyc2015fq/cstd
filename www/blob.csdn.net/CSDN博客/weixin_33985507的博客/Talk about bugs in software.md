There are certain kind of bugs in software really annoying me.
I define bugs in two kinds. one is positive. one is negative.
Let’s take Wechat as an example.
Wechat is famous for its wechat group, at least for me XD.
In the mac version of wechat, you’ll always find that there are contacts missing… so you are gonna think that your friends has quit this group, and you feel upset XD.
