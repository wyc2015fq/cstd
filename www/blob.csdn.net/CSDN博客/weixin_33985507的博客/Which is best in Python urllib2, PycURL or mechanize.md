I'd really like some feedback on the pros/cons of these things so I can make the best choice for myself.Edit: added note on verb support in urllib2[python](http://scribefire-next/questions/tagged/python)[urllib2](http://scribefire-next/questions/tagged/urllib2)[mechanize](http://scribefire-next/questions/tagged/mechanize)[pycurl](http://scribefire-next/questions/tagged/pycurl)|[link](http://scribefire-next/q/2385855/1222391)|[edit](http://scribefire-next/posts/2385855/edit)|[flag](#)|edited [Jun 15 '11 at 15:54](http://scribefire-next/posts/2385855/revisions)[](http://scribefire-next/users/14942/tim-lesher)![](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b525bd392fda602f8ff8377e271cb662?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG)[](http://scribefire-next/users/14942/tim-lesher)[](http://scribefire-next/users/14942/tim-lesher)[Tim Lesher](http://scribefire-next/users/14942/tim-lesher)2,212925|asked Mar 5 '10 at 10:02[](http://scribefire-next/users/252091/bigredbob)![](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d008a7b23b2aac265a35199f1edaa7a1?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG)[](http://scribefire-next/users/252091/bigredbob)[](http://scribefire-next/users/252091/bigredbob)[bigredbob](http://scribefire-next/users/252091/bigredbob)48461383% accept rate||[link](http://scribefire-next/q/2385855/1222391)|[edit](http://scribefire-next/posts/2385855/edit)|[flag](#)|edited [Jun 15 '11 at 15:54](http://scribefire-next/posts/2385855/revisions)[](http://scribefire-next/users/14942/tim-lesher)![](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b525bd392fda602f8ff8377e271cb662?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG)[](http://scribefire-next/users/14942/tim-lesher)[](http://scribefire-next/users/14942/tim-lesher)[Tim Lesher](http://scribefire-next/users/14942/tim-lesher)2,212925|asked Mar 5 '10 at 10:02[](http://scribefire-next/users/252091/bigredbob)![](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d008a7b23b2aac265a35199f1edaa7a1?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG)[](http://scribefire-next/users/252091/bigredbob)[](http://scribefire-next/users/252091/bigredbob)[bigredbob](http://scribefire-next/users/252091/bigredbob)48461383% accept rate| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

|up vote22down voteaccepted|- `urllib2` is found in every Python install everywhere, so is a good base upon which to start.- `PycURL` is useful for people already used to using libcurl, exposes more of the low-level details of HTTP, plus it gains any fixes or improvements applied to libcurl.- `mechanize` is used to persistently drive a connection much like a browser would.It's not a matter of one being better than the other, it's a matter of choosing the appropriate tool for the job.|
