On Writing Well by William Zinsser
# Chapter 1 Gist
Writers should develop a voice that's enjoyable not only in its musical line but also in its avoidance of breeziness, condescension and clichés. Breeziness is crude, corny and verbose. Worse still, it's harder to read than good English. Clichés are the enemy of taste. Writers with good taste would choose words that have surprise, strength and precision. Although a perfect taste is a God-given flair, a certain amount can be acquired by studying the writers who have it. The trick is to imitate other writers and embrace the eloquence in our own language heritage.

# Chapter 3 Thoughts
> 
The common assumption is that the style is effortless. In fact the opposite is true: the effortless style is achieved by strenuous effort and constant refining.
Inexperienced writers miss this point. They think that all they have to do to achieve a causal effects is to be "just folks" -- good old Betty or Bob chatting over the back fence. They want to be a pal to the reader. They're so eager not to appeal formal that they don't even they to write good English.
我喜欢的中文作家大多都是上个世纪的，像老舍，林语堂，汪曾祺，沈从文，梁实秋等。这些老一代的作家文字功底之强大是现代作家所难以企及的，他们可以自由驾驭文字的风格，既可以很雅致也可以很市井很“俗气”。汪曾祺是出了明的雅俗同赏，他经常在同一篇文章里雅俗自由而流畅地切换，比如他的《胡同文化》，既有这样的口头语：“有窝头，就知足了。大腌萝卜，就不错。小酱萝卜，那还有什么说的。”也有这样古典的书面语：“西风残照，衰草离披，满目荒凉，毫无生气。”或俗或雅，都有着作者的匠心在里面。华丽而不晦涩，平淡而依然余味醇厚，所以即使过去了那么久，却依然读起来没有距离感和陌生感。反而现在的一些满是时下流行词的网络文学经常让我看得云里雾里，不知所云。有的文章中出现过“种草”、“老铁”等词，看似是赶时髦，却让人有种粗制滥造之感。双十一的时候在京东上买了一堆书，但好几本都很失望，语言华丽者华而不实，语言平淡者也依然言之无物。那些作家与上一代的经典作家相比，就像是新酒与陈年老酒的区别，即使同样是口语化的表达，但因为前者缺少一个慢慢发酵的过程，所以他们的文字读起来是廉价而无味的，后者则是经过了细致的酿造和选择的过程，是一种洗去铅华后的真纯。
