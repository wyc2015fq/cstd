Examples of the types of information that can be obtained about  various ArcGIS Server web services include: ArcGIS Server version, type of  layer, opacity of a layer, timespan the data covers in a layer, number of records  in a layer or table, full geographic extent of the web service, geometry of  the layer, can the layer be edited, can the data be sync’ed locally, is the  web service route or network enabled and what are its specifications, etc.|
|[Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Data](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/api-reference/html/N_Esri_ArcGISRuntime_Data.htm)|包含能访问与各种图层相关联的数据的类。可以从Geodatabase的FeatureTable的一行记录中得到Feature的属性和几何体信息。Geodatabase是一个存储空间数据的结构，内部的属性和几何信息都能被查询和编辑。属性信息可以通过ArcGIS Server web service的ServiceFeatureTable或者本地的GeodatabaseFeatureTable进行修改。开发者可以添加，删除图片，文字，文件，或者以附件的形式将上述内容存储与FeatureLayer中。|Contains classes that access attribute data associated with the  various layers. Developers can access Features which are attributes and  geometries in a row of a table and gain information from a FeatureTable in a  Geodatabase. A Geodatabase is a database storage structure that contains  spatial data. The attribute and geographic information in it can be queried  (spatially or textually) and edited. Developers can make use of  CodedValueDomans to specify an explicit set of valid values that can be set  as attributes in a Field. Fields are the columns of the table; they contains  various types (number, text, boolean, date, etc.) have names and are of a  specified size. The attribute information in a Geodatabase can be  obtained/modified either using an ArcGIS Server web service via a  ServiceFeatureTable or on the local device’s storage location via a  GeodatabaseFeatureTable. Additionally, developers can add or delete image,  text, and files stored as Attachments attribute information in  FeatureLayer’s.|

Developers use these classes as a starting point to request  data from ArcGIS Server, provide the appropriate security credentials, and  handle exception error messages if problems arise in communicating with  ArcGIS Server. These classes would typically be used by advanced developers  who want to write functionality that is otherwise not found in the ArcGIS  Runtime .NET SDK.|
|[Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/api-reference/html/N_Esri_ArcGISRuntime_LocalServices.htm)|包含可以与ArcGIS  Runtime 本地服务器相交互的类。不同于ArcGIS Server的是，它适用于离线数据处理任务。需要gbk文件，gbk文件可以从ArcGIS Desktop中使用Model builder或者python script生成。本地服务器同样支持mpk文件中的image layer和feature layer（图像层和要素层）。同样的，这些数据包也是从ArcGIS Desktop中生成的。|Contains classes to work with ArcGIS Runtime Local Server SDK, an  optional component of ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET that can be downloaded  separately for Windows (32- and 64-bit). ArcGIS Runtime Local Server is  primarily for executing offline geoprocessing tasks in your ArcGIS Runtime  applications. These tasks work in the same way as geoprocessing tasks  published from ArcGIS Server. Running a geoprocessing task on ArcGIS Runtime  Local Server requires a geoprocessing package (.gpk file). These packages are  authored in ArcGIS Desktop either using Model Builder or by writing a Python  script. ArcGIS Runtime Local Server also allows your application to consume  map image layers or feature layers that use local content in a map package  (.mpk file). These packages are authored and created using ArcGIS Desktop.  NOTE: The localServices namespace is in an assembly included with the  Esri.ArcGISRuntime.LocalServices NuGet package.|

|[Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Mapping](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/api-reference/html/N_Esri_ArcGISRuntime_Mapping.htm)|包括了创建，检索显示各种图层的类。对于开发者来说，开发的重点是显示各种图层以及展示其中包含的各种细节信息。而这些地理图层会包含在一个地图中，会有告知图层何时被加载，空间参考又是怎样，显示比例尺是多少等属性方法。与此同时，还存在一些高度抽象的图层类型，例如，Layer，ImageAdjustmentLayer和ImageTiledlayer。这些类可以用于创建自定义的图层类型。更多时候，开发者会使用从上述类继承的FeatureLayer，ArcGISMapImageLayer和ArcGISTiledLayer等。我们已经提供了数以百计的方法和事件来帮助你更好的开发软件。这些图层可以加载本地数据或者ArcGIS Server上部署的网络服务。支持栅格和矢量数据。|Contains the classes used to create, retrieve, and display all of  the various layers in your Geographic Information System (GIS) based  application. For most application developers, the central focus of your  programming efforts with the ArcGIS Runtime .NET SDK will be centered on  displaying layers of geographic information and having end users interact  with the rich information contained in the layers. These GIS layers are  contained with a Map, which has several properties and methods to aid in  determining things like: when the layers have loaded, obtaining the spatial  refernce of a layer, setting the viewable scale of the layers, etc. There are  some high level abstract layer types like: Layer, ImageAdjustmentLayer, and  ImageTiledLayer that could be used to create your own custom layer type but  this will not typical programming path for most developers. Rather, most  developers will write code where users will interact with layers that inherit  from these abstract classes, the most popular being: FeatureLayer,  ArcGISMapImageLayer. and ArcGISTiledLayer. There are literally hundreds of  Properties, Methods, and Events of which developers can program against to  spatially enable your application. Layers can come from various sources such  as ArcGIS Server web services and local datasets (geodatabase or file based)  on the device. The layers that can be accessed can be vector or raster based  sources.|
