Welcome to **DevMaster's Game and Graphics Engines Database**, your ultimate source for 3D Engines. This database is committed to providing you with the most accurate and up-to-date information for current engines around the web. Each engine contains a brief description as well as a list of supported features and general info (platform, API, etc.). In addition, you will find reviews/ratings from DevMaster.net staff or community members to help you decide which engine is right for you. This is a great way to know how your engine compares with others or to learn how engines use state-of-the-art technology. Be sure to share your thoughts about any engine you are familiar with by reviewing it.
If you know of or have an engine that you suggest be included in our database, feel free to use our [submission form](http://www.devmaster.net/engines/submit.php). While we try our best to keep engines up-to-date, they do not necessarily reflect the latest version available. If you find any outdated/inaccurate information, we *highly* encourage you to submit the changes by clicking on the edit link (![Edit](http://www.devmaster.net/icons1/edit.gif) - located in the top-right corner) on the engine in question.
