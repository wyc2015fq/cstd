1. 基本相交测试. 只需要测试包围盒的两个角(这个几乎所有人都做了)
2. 平面连续测试. 根据上次测试的结果来优化用于测试的平面顺序
3. 八分体测试. 对于对称的视锥体可以减少一半的测试
4. 父子测试. 对于有父子关系的包围盒, 父在内则子在内, 父在外则子在外, 父相交则需要递归测试(四叉/八叉之类的肯定也做过了)
5. 变换连续测试. 根据移动和旋转的方向来优化测试. 如上一帧在外的处于移动方向的相反方向的话, 这帧肯定也在外面.
6. 雷达测试(Gems5). 适用于包围体为球形的情况.

There is a lot of material out there and 
you may want to explore it further, so here are a few pointers both for printed 
material as well as online stuff.
The book from Moller and Haines, [Real-Time 
Rendering 2nd ed.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568811829/3dtech/), is a very complete source of information. 
Assarson and Moller wrote an article on this subject [Optimized View Frustum 
Culling Algorithms for Bounding Boxes](http://www.ce.chalmers.se/~uffe/vfc_bbox.pdf), published in the Journal of Graphic 
Tools where most of the optimizations mentioned here are presented. 
The document from Gribb and Hartmann, entitled [Fast 
Extraction of Viewing Frustum Planes from the World- View-Projection Matrix](http://www2.ravensoft.com/users/ggribb/plane%20extraction.pdf) 
has been around for some time and explores the extraction phase of the view 
frustum planes both for OpenGL (as detailed in this tutorial) and Direct3D. 
Mark Morley had a document called Frustum Culling in OpenGL, but I can't find 
it anymore. It used to be [here](http://www.markmorley.com/). 
Daniel Sýkora and Josef Jelínek have published a work entitled [Efficient 
View Frustum Culling](http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/studentwork/CESCG/CESCG-2002/DSykoraJJelinek/) where besides providing information about the view 
frustum culling process, also provide test results on some optimizations. 
Eric Lengyel, in the book [Mathematics for 
3D game programming and Computer Graphics](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584502770/3dtech/) has a section on plane extraction. 
Dion Picco has written an article for Flipcode called [Frustum 
Culling](http://www.flipcode.com/articles/article_frustumculling.shtml) where some optimizations for the testing phase are discussed. 
[Game 
Programming Gems 5](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584503521/3dtech/) has an article by Frank Puig Placeres, entitled "Improved 
Frustum Culling" where the "radar approach" is introduced.
